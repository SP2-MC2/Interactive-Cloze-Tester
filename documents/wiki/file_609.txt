List of historical drama films.The historical drama is a film genre in which stories are based upon historical events and famous persons. Some historical dramas attempt to accurately portray a historical event or biography, to the degree that the available historical research will allow. Other historical dramas are fictionalized tales that are based on an actual person and their deeds, such as "Braveheart", which is loosely based on the 13th century knight William Wallace's fight for Scotland's independence, and "Saving Private Ryan", a heavily fictionalised version of a search for a paratrooper of the US 101st Airborne Division during World War II.
