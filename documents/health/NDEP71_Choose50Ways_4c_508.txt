To get started, use these tips to help you move more, make healthy food choices, and track your progress.Reduce Portion SizesPortion size is the amount of food you eat, such as 1 cup of fruit or 6 ounces of meat. If you are trying to eat smaller portions, eat a half of a bagel instead of a whole bagel or have a 3-ounce hamburger instead of a 6-ounce hamburger. Three ounces is about the size of your fist or a deck of cards. Put less on your plate, Nate.   1.Drink a large glass of water 10 minutes before your meal so you feel less hungry.  2.Keep meat, chicken, turkey, and fish portions to about 3 ounces.3.Share one  dessert.Eat a small meal, Lucille.  4.Use teaspoons, salad forks, or  child-size forks, spoons, and knives to help you take smaller bites and eat less. 5.Make less food look like more by serving your meal on a salad or breakfast plate.6.Eat slowly. It takes 20 minutes for your stomach to send a signal to your brain that you are full.7.Listen to music while you eat instead of watching TV (people tend to eat more while watching TV).How much should I eat?Try filling your plate like this:A plate with a cooked chicken filet, yellow rice, collard greens, and a sliced orange. The plate is labeled one half vegetables and fruit, one quarter grains, and one quarter protein. Near the plate is a glass of milk labeled dairy, low fat or skim milk.National Diabetes Education Program, a program of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Move More Each Day Find ways to be more active each day.
