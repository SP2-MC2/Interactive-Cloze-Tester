Peripheral Arterial Disease in the Legs 

Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) in the Legs

or lower extremities is the narrowing or blockage of the vessels that carry blood 
from the heart to the legs. It is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque 
in the arteries, which is called atherosclerosis. PAD can occur in any blood 
vessel, but it is more common in the legs than the arms.

Risk Factors for PAD

Smoking Diabetes 

High Blood Pressure High Cholesterol 

 Atherosclerosis Older than Age 60

Men and women are equally affected by PAD; 
however, black race/ethnicity is associated with an 
increased risk of PAD. People of Hispanic origin may 
have similar to slightly higher rates of PAD 
compared to non-Hispanic whites. Approximately 
8 million people in the United States have PAD, 
including 12–20% of individuals older than age 60. 
General population awareness of PAD is estimated 
at 25%, based on prior studies.2 

Other clinical conditions and disorders of arteries can 
mimic the symptoms of PAD, and not all PAD is due 
to atherosclerosis.3-4

Signs and Symptoms of PAD

The classic symptom of PAD is pain in the legs with exertion such as walking, which 
is relieved by resting. However, up to 40% of individuals with PAD have no leg pain. 
Symptoms of pain, ache, or cramp with walking (claudication) can occur in the 
buttock, hip, thigh, or calf.3 

Physical signs in the leg that may indicate peripheral arterial disease include muscle 
atrophy, hair loss, smooth shiny skin, skin that is cool to the touch especially if 
accompanied by pain while walking (which is relieved by stopping walking), 
decreased or absent pulses in the feet, non-healing ulcers or sores on the legs or 
feet, and cold or numb toes.3 4 

Preventing PAD background. 


Preventing PAD

• Physical activity and exercise are import for preventing 
PAD and for improving symptoms of PAD.3 

• Avoid use of tobacco—smoking increases the risk of 
PAD by 2–6 times and it worsens the symptoms of PAD.5 

• Control high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. 

Supervised exercise training programs can 
improve and prolong walking distance in 
individuals with PAD.

Diagnosis and Treatment of PAD

In patients with symptoms of PAD, the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a non-invasive 
test that measures the blood pressure in the ankles and compares it with the blood 
pressure in the arms at rest and after exercise. Imaging tests such as ultrasound, 
magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomographic (CT) 
angiography can provide additional information in diagnosing PAD.2-4 

• Individuals with PAD are at risk for developing coronary artery 
disease and cerebrovascular disease, which could lead to a 
heart attack or stroke.5 

• Aspirin or other similar anti-platelet medications may prevent 
the development of serious complications from PAD and 
associated atherosclerosis.3,5 

• All efforts must be made to stop smoking. 

• Severe cases may require surgery to bypass blocked arteries.
