Women’s bodies also react differently to alcohol than men’s bodies. As a result, women face particular health risks and realities. Women should be aware of the health risks associated with drinking alcohol, especially because most women drink at least occasionally, and many women drink a lot.  Why Do Women Face Higher Risk?Research shows that women start to have alcohol-related problems at lower drinking levels than men do. One reason is that, on average, women weigh less than men. In addition, alcohol resides predominantly in body water, and pound for pound, women have less water in their bodies than men do. So after a man and woman of the same weight drink the same amount of alcohol, the woman’s blood alcohol concentration will tend to be higher, putting her at greater risk for harm. Other biological differences, including hormones, may contribute as well.What Are the Health Risks?Liver Damage: Women who drink are more likely to develop alcoholic hepatitis (liver inflammation) than men who drink the same amount of alcohol. Alcoholic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis.Heart Disease:Chronic heavy drinking is a leading cause of heart disease. Among heavy drinkers, women are more Photo of three young women eating and laughingsusceptible to alcohol-related heart disease than men, even though women drink less alcohol over a lifetime than men. Breast Cancer:There is an association between drinking alcohol and developing breast cancer. Women who consume about one drink per day have a 10 percent higher chance of developing breast cancer than women who do not drink at all. That risk rises another 10 percent for every extra drink they have per day.Pregnancy:Any drinking during pregnancy is risky. A pregnant woman who drinks heavily puts her fetus at risk for learning and behavioral problems and abnormal facial features. Even moderate drinking during pregnancy can cause problems. Drinking during pregnancy also may increase the risk for preterm labor.Some women should never drink at all, including:»»Anyone under age 21»»Anyone who takes medications that can interact negatively with alcohol»»Anyone who is pregnant or trying to conceive

A large cup of beer, an overpoured glass of wine, or a single mixed drink could contain much more alcohol than a standard drink. In addition, while the alcohol concentrations listed are “typical,” there is considerable variability in alcohol content within each type of beverage (e.g., beer, wine, distilled spirits).NIH . . .

NIAAA also defines how much drinking may put people at risk for developing alcohol dependence. Low-risk drinking limits are: »»Women: No more than 7 drinks per week and no more than 3 drinks on any single day.»»Men: No more than 14 drinks per week and no more than 4 drinks on any single day. To stay low risk, you must keep within both the single-day and weekly limits. Low risk does not mean no risk. Even within these limits, you can have problems if you drink too quickly or have other health issues. Drinking slowly, and making sure you eat enough while drinking, can help minimize alcohol’s effects.December 2015
