Scan analysis is done via the cloud, and there is a cyber capture function that records unknown files, sends them to Avast, and figures if out they are a threat or not<\/div><div>&nbsp;What features and benefits does this antivirus software have?<\/div><div>&nbsp;Protection from viruses and malware is the main goal of Avast Free Antivirus 2017, plus with CyberCapture, it examines your unknown files to find out if they are threats or not. The software has numerous micro-updates through the day as the Avast company updates its malware and virus database. The 2017 version is faster because it doesn't rely as heavily on your device's processor as previous versions did. It is more lightweight and streamlined. The software has a behavior shield that monitors your apps and programs in real time and the antivirus is triggered if a program or app begins to act suspiciously. You may scan your device using Avast's powerful features and scans, and it will not conflict with your other anti-virus software. You may also take advantage of their software updater, which notifies you which of your programs are out of date, so that you may update them, which makes them less vulnerable. Avast also has a Wi-Fi inspector features that helps weed out the unsafe Wi-Fi networks from the safe ones.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Easy to use and tricky to learn<\/div><div>&nbsp;Getting the hang of what each function does and how the tools are used is a little tricky, but once you have learned how to do it, you will easily be able to trigger the functions and settings you desire. Avast Free Antivirus 2017 is compatible with Windows 10, though the interface isn't modeled on it. Nevertheless, people who are computer literate will find Avast easy and intuitive to use. From a single Avast account, you may control all of your device's protection, and their smart-scan technology helps you tune up and speed up your computer or device with just a few clicks and default settings. One of the less obvious user-interface features is the program's ability to hold back notifications and other interruptions while games are playing. With Avast passwords, you are able to auto-fill out all your login information because it is a powerful password manager, which means you do not have to remember your passwords anymore.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Current Avast users should update and new users should consider it<\/div><div>&nbsp;If you are currently an Avast user, then there is no excuse for not downloading and installing the newest 2017 version because it is far faster, lighter and more efficient than previous generations of the software. If you have never tried Avast before, then you may rest assured that it will not conflict with your current paid or free anti-malware and antivirus software. There are versions suitable for different needs, such as for personal, business or large business, and the software has different subscription levels where each tier adds yet more features. If you are looking for anti-malware and antivirus software, then Avast's 2017 version is a strong contender.&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q611","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"A free antivirus program you may use on your computer or mobile device \u00a0Avast Free Antivirus 2017...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID612"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID450","SecondaryAttribute":"A Healthy Mouth for Your Baby Illustration of a baby boy with a wide smile that shows his white t...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<p>A Healthy Mouth for Your Baby \nIllustration of a baby boy with a wide smile that shows his white teeth.  \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n National Institutes of Health\n \n\nHealthy teeth are important\u2014  even baby teeth.

Research suggests that people who attempt suicide differ from others in many aspects of how they think, react to events, and make decisions. There are differences in aspects of memory, attention, planning, and emotion, for example. These differences often occur along with disorders like depression, substance use, anxiety, and psychosis. Sometimes suicidal behavior is triggered by events such as personal loss or violence. In order to be able to detect those at risk and prevent suicide, it is crucial that we understand the role of both long-term factors\u00d1such as experiences in childhood\u00d1and more immediate factors like mental health and recent life events. Researchers are also looking at how genes can either increase risk or make someone more resilient to loss and hardships. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Many people have some of these risk factors but do not attempt suicide. Suicide is not a normal response to stress. It is, however, a sign of extreme distress, not a harmless bid for attention.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">What about gender?<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Men are more likely to die by suicide than women, but women are more likely to attempt suicide. Men are more likely to use deadlier methods, such as firearms or suffocation. Women are more likely than men to attempt suicide by poisoning.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">What about children?<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Children and young people are at risk for suicide.

Programs that work take into account people\u00d5s risk factors and promote interventions that are appropriate to specific groups of people. For example, research has shown that mental and substance abuse disorders are risk factors for suicide. Therefore, many programs focus on treating these disorders in addition to addressing suicide risk specifically.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Psychotherapy, or \u00d2talk therapy,\u00d3 can effectively reduce suicide risk. One type is called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

This causes problems for other services, such as sending mail.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Fortunately, there is a way around it, its just a matter of changing your Tor exit policy so that certain ports are not allowed. It seems as if these block lists only list Tor exit nodes that enable certain well-known ports that are used for abuse.

Cajun cuisine heavily relied on game meats supplemented with rice or corn. Other than African cuisine, French, Spanish and Native American culinary influences can also be detected in Cajun food. Another feature of the cuisine was the frequent use of smoked meats. Smoked meats are a common aspect of many Cajun dishes.Deep-frying of turkeys or oven-roasted turduckens entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, blackening of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine.Cajun ingredients.The following is a partial list of ingredients used in Cajun cuisine and some of the staple ingredients of the Acadian food culture.Meat and seafood.Cajun folkways include many ways of preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and mass-produced meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or duck confit (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.Game (and hunting) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.The recent increase of catfish farming in the Mississippi Delta has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in the place of the more traditional wild-caught trout (the saltwater species) and redfish.Also included in the seafood mix are some so-called \"trash fish\" that would not sell at market because of their high bone to meat ratio or required complicated cooking methods. These were brought home by fishermen to feed the family. Examples are garfish, black drum also called gaspergou or just \"goo\", croaker, and bream.Though parts of Acadiana are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Cajun form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the southern US, although seasoned differently.Dairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are no unique dairy items prepared in Cajun cuisine. Traditional southern US and New Orleans influenced desserts are common.Cajun dishes.Primary favorites.Boudin (sometimes spelled \"boudain\" in Texas) is a type of sausage made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic and green onion, and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. Boudin is usually made daily as it does not keep well for very long, even frozen. Boudin is typically stuffed in a natural casing and has a softer consistency than other, better-known sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, maque choux, or bread.High on the list of favorites of Cajun cooking are the soups called gumbos. Gumbo exemplifies the influence of African and Native American food cultures on Cajun cuisine. The word originally meant \"okra\", which is a word brought to the region from western Africa. Okra, which is a principal ingredient of many gumbo recipes, is used as a thickening agent and for its distinct vegetable flavor.Another classic Cajun dish is jambalaya. The only certain thing that can be said about a jambalaya is that it contains rice and almost anything else. Usually, however, one will find green peppers, onions, celery and hot chile peppers. Anything else is optional.Food as an event.The crawfish boil is a celebratory event where Cajuns boil crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn over large propane cookers. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper and other spices, commonly known as \"crab boil\" or \"crawfish boil\" are added to the water for seasoning. The results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in spice blends, such as Zatarain's, Louisiana Fish Fry or Tony Chachere's. Also, Cocktail sauce, mayonnaise and hot sauce sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand. During times when crawfish are not abundant, shrimp and crabs are prepared and served in the same manner.Attendees are encouraged to \"suck the head\" of a crawfish by separating the abdomen of the crustacean and sucking out the abdominal fat\/juices. The practice is known by the common phrase is \"Pinch the tail, suck the head.\" Other popular practices include kissing the tail section of a soon-to-be-cooked crawfish, leading to the vulgar phrase: \"Kiss my ass, suck my head, eat me.\" The phrase has been printed on shirts and posters in years past.Often, newcomers to the crawfish boil or those unfamiliar with the traditions are jokingly warned \"not to eat the dead ones.\" When live crawfish are boiled, their tails curl beneath themselves. When dead crawfish are boiled, their tails are straight and limp.Seafood boils with crabs and shrimp are also popular.The traditional pig-slaughtering party, or, where Cajuns would gather to socialize, play music, dance, and preserve meat does still occur in some rural communities, especially St. Martinville, but the use of every last bit of meat, including organs and variety cuts in sausages such as 'boudin' (sometimes spelled boudain) and the inaccessible bits in the head as head cheese is no longer a necessity.<\/div><div><br><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q6","QuestionID":"QID6"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID421","SecondaryAttribute":"Abdominal Adhesions National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse Logo of the U.S. Depart...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<p>Abdominal\nAdhesions\n\nNational Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse \nLogo of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \nLogo of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nWhat are abdominal adhesions? \nAbdominal adhesions are bands of fibrous tissue that can form between abdominal tissues and organs. Normally, internal tissues and organs have slippery surfaces, preventing them from sticking together as the body moves. However, abdominal adhesions cause tissues and organs in the abdominal cavity to stick together. \n\nWhat is the abdominal cavity? \nThe abdominal cavity is the internal area of the body between the chest and hips that contains the lower part of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The esophagus carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach, which slowly pumps them into the small and large intestines. Abdominal adhesions can kink, twist, or pull the small and large intestines out of place, causing an intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction, also called a bowel obstruction, results in the partial or complete blockage of movement of food or stool through the intestines. \nDrawing of the gastrointestinal tract showing the esophagus, stomach, and large intestine. Inset shows abdominal adhesions on the small intestine. \nAbdominal adhesions are bands of fibrous tissue that can form between abdominal tissues and organs. \n\nWhat causes abdominal adhesions? \nAbdominal surgery is the most frequent cause of abdominal adhesions. Surgery-related causes include \n\u2022\t \ncuts involving internal organs \n\n\u2022\t \nhandling of internal organs \n\n\u2022\t \ndrying out of internal organs and tissues \n\n\u2022\t \ncontact of internal tissues with foreign materials, such as gauze, surgical gloves, and stitches \n\n\u2022\t \nblood or blood clots that were not \nrinsed away during surgery\n \n\n\nAbdominal adhesions can also result from inflammation not related to surgery, including \n\u2022\t \nappendix rupture \n\n\u2022\t \nradiation treatment \n\n\u2022\t \ngynecological infections \n\n\u2022\t \nabdominal infections \n\n\nRarely, abdominal adhesions form without apparent cause. \n\nHow common are abdominal adhesions and who is at risk? \nOf patients who undergo abdominal surgery, 93 percent develop abdominal adhesions.1 Surgery in the lower abdomen and pelvis, including bowel and gynecological operations, carries an even greater chance of abdominal adhesions. Abdominal adhesions can become larger and tighter as time passes, sometimes causing problems years after surgery. \n1Ward BC, Panitch A.  Abdominal adhesions: current and novel therapies. Journal of Surgical Research. 2011;165(1):91\u2013111. \nWhat are the symptoms of abdominal adhesions? \nIn most cases, abdominal adhesions do not cause symptoms. When symptoms are present, chronic abdominal pain is the most common. \n\nWhat are the complications of abdominal adhesions? \nAbdominal adhesions can cause intestinal obstruction and female infertility\u2014the inability to become pregnant after a year of trying. \nAbdominal adhesions can lead to female infertility by preventing fertilized eggs from reaching the uterus, where fetal development takes place. Women with abdominal adhesions in or around their fallopian tubes have an increased chance of ectopic pregnancy\u2014a fertilized egg growing outside the uterus. Abdominal adhesions inside the uterus may result in repeated miscarriages\u2014a pregnancy failure before 20 weeks. \nSeek Help for Emergency Symptoms \nA complete intestinal obstruction is life threatening and requires immediate medical attention and often surgery. Symptoms of an intestinal obstruction include \n\u2022\t \nsevere abdominal pain or cramping \n\n\u2022\t \nnausea \n\n\u2022\t \nvomiting \n\n\u2022\t \nbloating \n\n\u2022\t \nloud bowel sounds \n\n\u2022\t \nabdominal swelling \n\n\u2022\t \nthe inability to have a bowel \nmovement or pass gas\n \n\n\u2022\t \nconstipation\u2014a condition in which a person has fewer than three bowel movements a week; the bowel movements may be painful \n\n\nA person with these symptoms should seek medical attention immediately. \n\nHow are abdominal adhesions and intestinal obstructions diagnosed? \nAbdominal adhesions cannot be detected by tests or seen through imaging techniques such as x rays or ultrasound. Most abdominal adhesions are found during surgery performed to examine the abdomen. However, abdominal x rays, a lower gastrointestinal (GI) series, and computerized tomography (CT) scans can diagnose intestinal obstructions. \n\u2022\t \nAbdominal x rays use a small amount of radiation to create an image that is recorded on film or a computer. An x ray is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. An x ray does not require anesthesia. The person will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The x-ray machine is positioned over the abdominal area. The person will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. The person may be asked to change position for additional pictures. \n\n\u2022\t \nA lower GI series is an x-ray exam that is used to look at the large intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. The health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. A laxative or an enema may be used before the test. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves flushing water or laxative into the rectum using a special squirt bottle. \nFor the test, the person will lie on a table while the radiologist inserts a flexible tube into the person\u2019s anus. The large intestine is filled with barium, making signs of underlying problems show up more clearly on x rays. \n\n\u2022\t \nCT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. The procedure is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. The person will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. \n\n\n\nHow are abdominal adhesions and intestinal obstructions treated? \nAbdominal adhesions that do not cause symptoms generally do not require treatment. Surgery is the only way to treat abdominal adhesions that cause pain, intestinal obstruction, or fertility problems. More surgery, however, carries the risk of additional abdominal adhesions. People should speak with their health care provider about the best way to treat their abdominal adhesions. \nComplete intestinal obstructions usually require immediate surgery to clear the blockage. Most partial intestinal obstructions can be managed without surgery. \n\nHow can abdominal adhesions be prevented? \nAbdominal adhesions are difficult to prevent; however, certain surgical techniques can minimize abdominal adhesions. \nLaparoscopic surgery decreases the potential for abdominal adhesions because several tiny incisions are made in the lower abdomen instead of one large incision. The surgeon inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached\u2014into one of the small incisions. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor. Patients will usually receive general anesthesia during this surgery. \nIf laparoscopic surgery is not possible and a large abdominal incision is required, at the end of surgery a special filmlike material can be inserted between organs or between the organs and the abdominal incision. The filmlike material, which looks similar to wax paper and is absorbed by the body in about a week, hydrates organs to help prevent abdominal adhesions. \nOther steps taken during surgery to reduce abdominal adhesions include \n\u2022\t \nusing starch- and latex-free gloves \n\n\u2022\t \nhandling tissues and organs gently \n\n\u2022\t \nshortening surgery time \n\n\u2022\t \nusing moistened drapes and swabs \n\n\u2022\t \noccasionally applying saline solution \n\n\n\nEating, Diet, and Nutrition \nResearchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing abdominal adhesions. A person with a partial intestinal obstruction may relieve symptoms with a liquid or low-fiber diet, which is more easily broken down into smaller particles by the digestive system. \n\nPoints to Remember \n\u2022\t \nAbdominal adhesions are bands of fibrous tissue that can form between abdominal tissues and organs. Abdominal adhesions cause tissues and organs in the abdominal cavity to stick together. \n\n\u2022\t \nAbdominal surgery is the most \nfrequent cause of abdominal \nadhesions. Of patients who \nundergo abdominal surgery, \n93 percent develop abdominal \nadhesions. \n\n\n\u2022\t \nIn most cases, abdominal adhesions do not cause symptoms. When symptoms are present, chronic abdominal pain is the most common. \n\n\u2022\t \nA complete intestinal obstruction is life threatening and requires immediate medical attention and often surgery. \n\n\u2022\t \nAbdominal adhesions cannot be detected by tests or seen through imaging techniques such as x rays or ultrasound. However, abdominal x rays, a lower gastrointestinal (GI) series, and computerized tomography (CT) scans can diagnose intestinal obstructions. \n\n\u2022\t \nSurgery is the only way to treat abdominal adhesions that cause pain, intestinal obstruction, or fertility problems. \n\n\n\nHope through Research \nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) conducts and supports basic and clinical research into many digestive disorders. \nClinical trials are research studies involving people.

People usually base the excuses on an assumption such as, The application isnt critical because it doesnt process or store sensitive information. When it comes to mobile apps, dont jump to that conclusion too quickly. The mobile apps used by your customers, workforce, and partners generate, store, and transmit personal and sensitive information in ways that arent always obvious. You need to test any assumptions you make about the security of a mobile app from an attackers perspective to eliminate a number of common mobile app security risks.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Mobile apps have replaced traditional client\/server models, and now people spend more time using mobile apps and devices (51 percent of time) than desktop or laptop computers (42 percent of time) or other connected devices (7 percent of the time). Mobile app workflows are complex, and the data they handle is sensitive. The risks are high&nbsp; arguably higher than in any other application medium given that mobile devices are easily lost or stolen. Furthermore, because mobile systems are often not locked down in the same ways as traditional business workstations, theyre even more susceptible to abuse. Its the perfect storm of BYOD, shadow IT, and lack of visibility into the network\/application environment thats creating considerable business risk.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Common mobile app security risks<\/p><p>&nbsp;I come across a lot of security vulnerabilities when I perform assessments of mobile apps. Some, like the following, tend to be predictable, and thus, should be on your radar.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Network communication sessions that are unencrypted or are running via SSL and encryption ciphers that are known to be at risk: Sensitive data traveling over a mobile carriers network, Wi-Fi, and the Internet is at risk of being exposed. For example, a malicious individual may intercept mobile data by eavesdropping on Wi-Fi traffic. To mitigate against this risk, make sure all connections between your app and other services are properly encrypted. That includes using SSL\/TLS, making sure that the app only accepts valid certificates that use a strong cipher, not accepting self-signed certificates, and in many cases implementing certificate pinning.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Weak password requirements and enforcement, lack of user session timeouts, and lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts: If user authentication mechanisms within the mobile app are weak or non-existent, a malicious individual can spoof authentication to the apps backend without needing to manipulate the app itself. Weak authentication can expose your users and increase the risk of fraudulent transactions.<\/p><p>&nbsp;In a draft of its digital identity guidelines, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends that passwords be at least eight characters in length and encourages allowing users to create passwords as long as they like. Depending on the sensitivity of the actions that users can perform using your mobile app, consider implementing two-factor authentication as well.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Finally, to prevent against unauthorized access to app data in the case of a lost or stolen device:<\/p><p>&nbsp;Lock an account out after a certain number of failed log-in attempts to prevent brute force attacks<\/p><p>&nbsp;Terminate active app sessions after a period of non-use and require the user to log back in<\/p><p>&nbsp;Poor input validation that allows for users (and attackers) to inject legitimate commands and random junk into input fields: A malicious actor can exploit a lack of, or poor, input validation to execute SQL injection, command injection, and other attacks. You can prevent these kind of attacks on your mobile apps backend by validating input from the app and user before transmission from client to host and during receipt.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Sensitive artifacts such as login credentials stored in unsafe ways, that are never cleaned up and left vulnerable: Its best to assume that any data your app writes to a device is recoverable. So, unless its absolutely necessary, simply avoid storing or caching data. Also, be sure to check whether your app is storing data in places you dont realize such as log and debug files, cookies, web history, web cache, property lists, SQLite databases, and elsewhere. For the most part, you need to know what data your app is storing, whether storing that data is necessary (if not, stop storing it), and that any data you absolutely must store is stored securely.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Modeling mobile app security threats<\/p><p>&nbsp;Even when sensitive information, per se, is not processed or stored by these mobile apps, theres still the risk of users re-using credentials which increases the risk of unauthorized access or exposure of other systems. At a higher level, metadata generated, stored or transmitted by a mobile device or app can provide an attacker with reconnaissance that leads to other certain business systems and third-party relationships that can be further exploited.<\/p><p>&nbsp;The threat scenarios are endless. In addition, you also need to consider the risks of damage to your brand and reputation (and other intangibles) should your mobile app fall victim to an attack as a result of one of these types of flaws.<\/p><p>&nbsp;When assessing the security of a mobile app, source code analysis can help (and I always advise it). Notice that none of the weaknesses listed above are particularly sneaky or hard to find. Just take a look at any number of low-hanging-fruit-type examples of security vulnerabilities that Ive written about in the past. Many of the vulnerabilities listed above only come to light as a result of examining the apps behavior during runtime. A comprehensive assessment of a mobile apps security must include both static analysis (evaluating code in a non-runtime environment) and dynamic analysis (analyzing the app as it operates during runtime).<\/p><p>&nbsp;What causes these common mobile app security weaknesses?<\/p><p>&nbsp;From my experience, these weaknesses are usually introduced into the mobile apps genetics and implementation through poor requirements definitions, weak threat modeling, and no ongoing security testing. No business, regardless of its size, industry, or level of security maturity is immune to these mobile app flaws.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Remember, you need to test your assumptions. Dont assume that someone else is going to take care of these security issues. And dont ignore these common mobile app security risks simply because people arent asking about them or addressing them isnt required by contracts or regulations. The risks are there. Its just a matter of time before theyre brought to the surface. Youll want to make sure you find them before someone else does.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Developing apps for iOS or Android?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Check out our list of 50+ practical recommendations on how to develop more secure apps.&nbsp;<\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q561","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"After performing independent security assessments for more than two decades, Ive heard just about...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID561","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID463","SecondaryAttribute":"Alcohol abuse is a serious public health concern.

Did you know that alcohol can harm a fetus at any point in its development,often before a woman knows she\u2019s pregnant?\n\u201cFetal alcohol spectrum disorders\u201d (FASD) is an umbrella term describing the range of effects thatcan occur in an individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. These effects may includephysical, mental, behavioral, and\/or learning disabilities with lifelong implications. The term FASDis not intended for use as a clinical diagnosis. It refers to conditions such as fetal alcohol syndrome(FAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and alcohol-related birth defects(ARBD).\nIf women do not drink alcohol during pregnancy, FASD is 100 percent preventable. The SurgeonGeneral issued an advisory in February 2005 to help share this important message and to urge healthprofessionals to identify and assist women who are drinking or at risk of drinking during pregnancy.\nWHO IS AT RISK?Any pregnant woman who drinks alcohol is at risk of havinga child with an FASD, regardless of her education, income,or ethnicity. Women who are at particularly high risk ofdrinking during pregnancy and having a child with an FASDinclude:\u2022Women with substance abuse or mental health problems\u2022Women who have already had a child with an FASD1,2\u2022Recent drug users\u2022Smokers\u2022Women who have multiple sex partners\u2022Recent victims of abuse and violenceAlcohol is a potent teratogen, a substance that can damagea developing fetus.

They are usually skin or blood tests.\nHowever, allergy tests alone are generally not enough. It is important to have a doctor\u2019s exam and medical history first to help diagnose allergies. If the exam and medical history point to allergies, allergy tests may help find what you are allergic to. But if you don\u2019t have symptoms and you haven\u2019t had a medical exam that points to an allergy, you should think twice about allergy testing. Here\u2019s why:\nAllergy tests, without a doctor\u2019s exam, usually are not reliable. \nMany drugstores and supermarkets offer free screenings. And you can even buy kits to test for allergies yourself at home. But the results of these tests may be misleading.\n\u2022 \tThe tests may say you have an allergy when you \t\tdo not. This is called a \u201cfalse positive.\u201d\n\u2022 \tThese free tests and home tests for food allergies \t\tare not always reliable. \nUnreliable test results can lead to unnecessary changes in your lifestyle. \nIf the test says you are allergic to some foods, such as wheat, soy, eggs, or milk, you may stop eating those foods. You may end up with a poor diet, \nunnecessary worries and frustration, or extra food costs. If the test says you are allergic to cats or dogs, you may give up a loved pet. \nAnd tests for chronic hives\u2014red, itchy, raised areas of the skin that last for more than six weeks\u2014can show something that may not look normal but is not a problem. However, this can lead to anxiety, more tests, and referrals to specialists.\n\n\n\t\t\n\nThe wrong test can be a waste of money.\nAllergy tests can cost a lot. A skin allergy test can cost $60 to $300. A blood test can cost $200 to $1,000. A blood test for food allergies can cost hundreds of dollars, and testing for chronic hives can cost thousands of dollars. Your health insurance may not cover the costs of these tests. And without a doctor\u2019s exam, the test may not even tell you what is causing your symptoms or how to treat them.\nSo, when should you have allergy tests?\nIf you have allergy symptoms, you may get relief from self-help steps and over-the-counter drugs. We talk about these in the blue section. If these steps do not help your symptoms, then it is time to see your doctor. \nThe doctor should ask you about your medical \nhistory and make sure you get the right tests. If \nyour medical history suggests that you have an \nallergy, your doctor might refer you to an allergist or immunologist (doctors who specialize in allergies) for testing. \n\u2022 \tA skin test is the most common kind of allergy \t\t\ttest. Your skin is pricked with a needle that has \n\ta tiny amount of something you might be \n\tallergic to. \n\u2022 \tIf you have a rash or take a medicine that could \t\t\taffect the results of a skin test, you may need a \n\tblood test.\n\u2022 \tFor chronic hives, you usually do not need an \n\tallergy test. However, your doctor might order \n\ttests to make sure that the hives are not caused \n\tby other conditions, such as thyroid disease, \n\tlymphoma, or lupus.\n\nAdvice from Consumer Reports&nbsp;\nHow should you manage allergies and hives?\n\nFood allergies. The only treatment for \nfood allergies is to \navoid the foods you \nare allergic to. \n \n\u2022\tRead the ingredients \t\tlist on packaged and \t\tcanned foods. When \t\tyou eat out, ask about \t\tingredients in dishes. \n \n\u2022\tIf you have had a serious reaction to certain \t\tfoods, wear a medical alert bracelet and carry \t\ta prescription of epinephrine that you can use \n\tif you have a reaction.\n \nOutdoor and indoor allergies. \n\u2022\tIf you have hay fever, you can check pollen \t\tcounts in your area at the National Allergy \n\tBureau website: www.aaaai.org. Try to stay \n\tindoors when pollen counts are high. \n \n\u2022\tFor indoor allergies, use an air-conditioner or \t\tdehumidifier. Regularly vacuum and wash \n\trugs and bedding. \n \n\u2022\tFor both indoor and outdoor allergies, consider \t\tan over-the-counter antihistamine, such as \n\tcetirizine, loratadine, or diphenhydramine. \n\tOr ask your doctor about a prescription steroid \t\tnasal spray.\nChronic hives. \n\u2022\tSee a doctor if you have chronic hives. The \n\tdoctor may recommend high doses of antihis-\t\ttamines. The doctor may prescribe famotidine \n\tor ranitidine, which are usually used to treat \n\theartburn but are also antihistamines. If those \t\tdrugs do not help, ask about prescription drugs \t\tsuch as generic montelukast or zafirlukast. \n \n\u2022\tAvoid alcohol, aspirin, and drugs such as \n\tgeneric ibuprofen or naproxen. These drugs \t\tcan make hives worse.\n\n\nThis report is for you to use when talking with your health-care provider.&nbsp;It is not a substitute for medical advice and treatment.&nbsp;\nUse of this report is at your own risk.\n\u00a9 2012 Consumer Reports.

NGOs, experts, donors, and policy makers collaborated through the project to identify common patterns of interaction between aid and conflict. CDA aimed to support efforts to prevent the inadvertent and unintentional negative impacts of aid on conflict.<\/div><div>&nbsp;CDA developed a framework for analyzing the impacts of aid on conflictand for taking action to reduce negative impacts and maximize positive impacts.

In this phase, 13 agencies collaborated directly with DNH in testing the usefulness and practicality of the framework. They used it in their project design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and redesign. CDA provided a liaison for each project to train organization staff, provide advice on how to use the framework, and return to the project site every three to four months to perform additional facilitation or training as needed, and to keep the approach foremost in the minds of project teams. DNH liaisons also documented the learning process and outcomes and reported the experiences gathered to the project. The lessons from this phase are captured in Options for Aid in Conflict: Lessons from Field Experience.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Starting in 2001, building on the lessons learned through implementation, the DNH program focused on mainstreaming DNH, by providing training, accompaniment and advice to organizations throughout the world.<\/div><div>&nbsp;From Principle to Practice<\/div><div>&nbsp;In 2006, CDA took up the task of finding out the current state of knowledge of DNH and what impact it had made on the way assistance workers designed and implemented programs.

The selected crew were: Command Pilot Virgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom, Senior Pilot Ed White and Pilot Roger B. Chaffee.However, during a preliminary test and launch rehearsal on January 27, 1967, a fire broke out in the cabin which killed all three and destroyed the Command Module (CM-012). This was the world's first crew fatality associated with a manned space flight.An Apollo 204 Review Board was quickly launched to determine the cause of the accident. Although the ignition source of the fire was never conclusively identified, the astronauts' deaths were attributed to a wide range of lethal design hazards in the early Apollo Command Module. The manned phase of Apollo was delayed for twenty months while these problems were fixed. The Saturn 1B launch vehicle SA-204 (Saturn\/Apollo) was re-used for the first unmanned Lunar Module test flight, Apollo 5.Mission background.AS-204 was to be the first manned flight of a command and service module (CSM) to Earth orbit, launched on a Saturn 1B. CM-012, the Apollo 1 command module, was a Block I design built for spaceflight but never intended for a trip to the moon since it lacked the needed docking equipment.The AS-204 mission was scheduled for February 21, 1967, having already missed a target date for the last quarter of 1966. The flight was to test \"launch operations, ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly\" and would have lasted up to two weeks, depending on how the spacecraft performed. Grissom resolved to keep AS-204 in orbit for a full 14 days if there was any way to do so.Apollo 1 was intended to be followed by two more Apollo flights in the summer and late autumn of 1967. The first of these would have launched a Block II Apollo CSM on a Saturn 1B along with an unmanned LM on a second Saturn 1B, both ascending to low earth orbit for a CSM-LM rendezvous and docking. The second flight would have launched the CSM and LM together on a Saturn V to high earth orbit. Both of these missions were canceled immediately following the fire.As it turned out, those planned dates proved to be completely unrealistic, since the Saturn V was not ready for its first \"unmanned\" test flight until November 9, 1967, and the LM was not similarly ready until January 22, 1968.The low earth orbit docking was finally achieved using a Saturn V on Apollo 9, launched on March 3, 1969. The high earth orbit mission was deemed unnecessary and cancelled to keep the program on track to a 1969 first lunar landing.Command module design worries.The Apollo Command Module was much bigger and far more complex than any previously implemented spacecraft design. It was built by North American Aviation, which had originally suggested the hatch open outward and carry explosive bolts in case of emergency. NASA didn't agree, arguing the hatch could be accidentally opened (which led to Grissom's \"Liberty Bell 7\" spacecraft sinking during splashdown recovery operations). Before the fire, astronauts successfully lobbied for an outward-opening hatch on future command modules, but NASA subsequently claimed the astronauts were thinking about ease of exit and entry for spacewalks (along with getting out of the CM after splashdown) rather than safety.North American Aviation also suggested the cabin atmosphere be an oxygen\/nitrogen mixture as on the Earth's surface. NASA objected, citing heightened risks such as catastrophic decompression sickness and mismanagement of nitrogen levels, which could cause the astronauts to pass out and die. NASA officials asserted a pure oxygen atmosphere had been used without incident in the Mercury and Gemini programs so it would be safe for use on Apollo. Also, a pure oxygen design saved weight.CM-012 was delivered to NASA with 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes. An additional 623 Engineering Orders were generated subsequent to delivery. The crew expressed serious concerns about fire hazards and other problems (Grissom even famously took a lemon from a tree by his house, telling his wife Betty, \"I'm going to hang it on that spacecraft\").The January 27, 1967 launch simulation, officially considered not hazardous because the Saturn 1B was not loaded with fuel, was a \"plugs-out\" test to determine whether the spacecraft would operate nominally on internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals. There was hope that if the spacecraft passed this and subsequent tests, it would be ready to fly on February 21, 1967.In a BBC documentary \"NASA: Triumph and Tragedy\", Jim McDivitt said that NASA had no idea how 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in a documentary \"In the Shadow of the Moon.\"Plugs-out test.At 1:00 PM (1800 GMT) on January 27 Grissom, White and Chaffee entered the command module fully suited, were strapped into their seats and hooked up to the spacecraft's systems in preparation for the plugs-out test. There were immediate problems. A sour \"buttermilk\" smell in the air circulating through Grissom's suit delayed the launch simulation until 2:42 PM. Three minutes later the hatch was sealed and high-pressure pure oxygen began replacing the air in the cabin.Further problems included episodes of high oxygen flow apparently linked to movements by the astronauts in their flightsuits. There were also faulty communications between the crew, the control room, the operations and checkout building and the complex 34 blockhouse. \"How are we going to get to the moon if we can't talk between three buildings?\" Grissom complained in frustration over the communication loop. This put the launch simulation on hold again at 5:40. Most countdown functions had been successfully completed by 6:20 but the countdown was still holding at T minus 10 minutes at 6:30 with all cables and umbilicals still attached to the command module while attempts were made to fix the communication problem.Fire.The crew members were reclining in their horizontal couches, running through a checklist when a voltage transient was recorded at 6:30:54 (23:30:54 GMT). Ten seconds later (at 6:31:04) Chaffee said, \"Hey...\" Scuffling sounds followed for three seconds before Grissom shouted \"Fire!\" Chaffee then reported, \"We've got a fire in the cockpit,\" and White said \"Fire in the cockpit!\"After nearly ten seconds of frenetic movement noises Chaffee yelled, \"We've got a bad fire! Let's get out! We're burning up! We're on fire! Get us out of here!\" Some witnesses said they saw Ed White on the television monitors, reaching for the hatch release handle as flames in the cabin spread from left to right and licked the window. Only 17 seconds after the first indication by crew of any fire, the transmission ended abruptly at 6:31:21 with a scream of pain as the cabin ruptured after rapidly expanding gases from the fire overpressurized the CM to 29 psi (200 kPa).Intense heat, dense toxic smoke, malfunctioning gas masks and shock waves and explosions from the cabin hampered the ground crew's rescue efforts. There were fears the fire might ignite the solid fuel rockets in the launch escape tower above the command module, likely killing nearby ground personnel. It took five minutes to open the inner and outer hatches, a set of three with many ratchets. By this time the fire in the command module had gone out. Although the cabin lights remained lit the ground crew was at first unable to find the astronauts. As the smoke cleared they found the bodies but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted the astronauts' nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom's body was found lying mostly on the deck. His and White's suits were fused together. The body of Ed White (whom mission protocol had tasked with opening the hatch) was lying back in his center couch. White would not have been able to open the inward-opening hatch against the internal pressure. Chaffee's job was to shut down the spacecraft systems and maintain communications with ground control. His body was still strapped into the right-hand seat.Aftermath.According to the Apollo 204 Review Board, Grissom suffered severe third degree burns on over a third of his body and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over almost a quarter of his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. It was later confirmed the crew had died of smoke inhalation with burns contributing. In later lawsuits brought by Gus Grissom's widow Betty Grissom there were claims the astronauts had lived longer than NASA claimed publicly.The review board found the documentation for CM-012 so lacking that they were at times unable to determine what had been installed in the spacecraft or what was in it at the time of the accident.Cause.Since the CM was designed to endure outward pressure in the vacuum of space, the plugs-out test had been run with the cabin pressure at over 16 psi, almost 2 psi above the ambient sea level pressure at Launch Complex 34 and near the upper limits of measuring devices in the spacecraft. This represented over 5 times the oxygen density carried within the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft while in spaceflight (which was only 3 psi but equal to the partial pressure of oxygen at sea level and thus very breathable). Following a worldwide survey of artificial oxygen-rich environments, it was found that rarely if ever had a 100% oxygen environment been created and maintained at such a high pressure, in which a bar of aluminum can burn like wood. The investigation also found much substandard wiring and plumbing in the craft along with a misplaced socket wrench. (which was ruled out as a cause). Hence, the fire was at first believed to have been caused by a spark somewhere in the over of wiring threaded throughout the command module.The review board noted a silver-plated copper wire running through an environmental control unit near the command module pilot's couch had become stripped of its Teflon insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of a small access door. This weak point in the wiring also ran near a junction in an ethylene glycol\/water cooling line which was known to be prone to leaks. The electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the silver anode was a notable hazard which could cause a violent exothermic reaction, igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the CM's corrosive test atmosphere of pure, high-pressure oxygen.The panel cited how the NASA crew systems department had installed of fuzzy Velcro throughout the spacecraft, almost like carpeting. This velcro was found to be explosive in a high-pressure 100% oxygen environment. Up to 70 pounds of other non-metallic flammable materials had crept into the design. Buzz Aldrin in \"Men From Earth\" states that the three astronauts complained that they wanted the flammable material removed, and that there was to be no flammable material in the spacecraft; the flammable material was removed, but was replaced prior to delivery to Cape Kennedy.In 1968 a team of MIT physicists went to Cape Kennedy and performed a static discharge test in the CM-103 command module while it was being prepared for the launch of Apollo 8. With an electroscope, they measured the approximate energy of static discharges caused by a test crew dressed in nylon flight pressure suits and reclining on the nylon flight seats. The MIT investigators found sufficient energy for ignition discharged repeatedly when crew-members shifted in their seats and then touched the spacecraft's aluminum panels.However, the ignition source for the Apollo 1 fire was never officially determined.Command module redesign.Thorough protocols were implemented for documenting spacecraft construction and maintenance. By all accounts the design changes were successful and justified the 21-month delay of the first manned mission, Apollo 7.1961 Soviet oxygen fire.In March 1961 Soviet cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko died after a fire that started in a high-oxygen isolation chamber. The USSR concealed the tragedy for over 20 years, which subsequently caused some speculation as to whether or not the \"Apollo 1\" disaster might have been averted had NASA been aware of the incident. However, the fire hazards of a 100%-oxygen sea-level pressure environment had been well described by 1967 and many deaths from flash fires had been publicly reported during the 1950s and 1960s. A 1966 editorial in the journal \"Space\/Aeronautics\" asserted \"The odds are that the first spaceflight casualty due to environmental exposure will occur not in space, but on the ground\", and further noted that safety protocols for the Apollo project were thoroughly lacking.Scapegoats.In May 1967, some U.S. Congressmen questioned NASA's selection of North American Aviation as the prime contractor for Apollo. On May 11, NASA Administrator James E. Webb issued a statement defending the selection. On June 9, Deputy Director Robert C. Seamans, Jr. filed a seven-page memorandum documenting the process that led to North American's selection in November 1961.Internally, some acrimony developed between NASA and North American over assignment of blame. North American argued unsuccessfully that it was not responsible for the fatal error in spacecraft atmosphere design. Finally, Webb contacted North American president Lee Atwood, and demanded that either he or Chief Engineer Harrison \"Stormy\" Storms resign. Atwood elected to fire Storms.On the NASA side, Joe Shea, manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, became unfit for duty in the aftermath and was removed from his position, although not fired.Mission insignia.The \"Apollo 1\" insignia has a center showing a command service module flying over the southeastern United States with Florida (the launch point) prominent. The moon is seen in the distance, symbolic of the eventual program goal. A yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes, trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by the crew, with the artwork done by Allen Stevens of Rockwell International.Memorials.Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Ed White was buried at the cemetery of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Their names are also enshrined on the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida.An Apollo 1 mission patch was left on the moon's surface during the first manned lunar landing by Apollo 11.Launch Complex 34.Launch Complex 34 was subsequently used only for the launch of Apollo 7 and later dismantled but the launch platform remains at the site () along with a few other concrete and steel-reinforced structures. The launch platform bears two plaques noting the tragedy.One reads: \"LAUNCH COMPLEX 34, Friday, 27 January 1967, 1831 Hours. Dedicated to the living memory of the crew of the Apollo 1: USAF. Lt. Colonel Virgil I. Grissom, USAF. Lt. Colonel Edward H. White, II, U.S.N. Lt. Commander Roger B. Chaffee. They gave their lives in service to their country in the ongoing exploration of humankind's final frontier. Remember them not for how they died but for those ideals for which they lived.\"The other reads: \"In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice so others could reach for the stars; Ad astra per aspera (a rough road leads to the stars); God speed to the crew of Apollo 1\"In January 2005 three granite benches built by a college classmate of one of the astronauts, one for each member of the crew, were installed at the site.Each year the families of the Apollo 1 crew are invited to the site for a memorial, and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center offers a visit to the site for those who choose to take a special tour to the older launch sites on Cape Canaveral.Naming of Apollo 1.When North American Aviation shipped spacecraft CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center it bore a banner proclaiming it as \"Apollo One\". Grissom's crew had received approval for an \"Apollo 1\" patch in June 1966 but NASA was planning to call the mission \"AS-204.\" After the fire, the astronauts' widows asked that \"Apollo 1\" be reserved for the flight their husbands never made.Apollo 1's (AS-204) Saturn IB rocket was taken down from Launch Complex 34, later reassembled at Launch Complex 37B and used to launch the \"Apollo 5\" LM-1 into earth orbit for the first Lunar Module test mission.Effect on early Apollo mission names.For a time mission planners called the next scheduled launch \"Apollo 2\". There were also suggestions the first Apollo CSM flights be named wholly out of chronological sequence as \"Apollo 1\" (AS-204), \"Apollo 1A\" (AS-201), \"Apollo 2\" (AS-202) and \"Apollo 3\" (AS-203) but the NASA project designation committee decided on \"Apollo 4\" for the first (unmanned) Apollo-Saturn V mission (AS-501), with no retroactive renaming of earlier missions. Hence, AS-203 is now sometimes informally (and chronologically) referred to as \"Apollo 2\" and likewise, AS-202 as \"Apollo 3\".Remains of CM-012.The \"Apollo 1\" command module has never been on public display. After the accident the burned-out spacecraft was removed and taken to Kennedy Space Center to be studied for any information that might prevent a recurrence of the tragedy. It was then moved to the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia and placed in a secured storage warehouse. On February 17, 2007 the wreckage of CM-012 was moved approximately to a newer, environmentally-controlled warehouse. Only a few weeks earlier Gus Grissom's brother Lowell publicly suggested CM-012 be permanently entombed in the concrete remains of Launch Complex 34.<\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Apollo 1.Apollo 1 is the official name that was retroactively assigned to the never-flown, first...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div><div>Annie's sister, Julia, was having a birthday party in the afternoon. &nbsp;Annie's mother was going to bake the cake for the party. &nbsp;Mother asked Annie to help her bake the cake. &nbsp;They chose to make a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. &nbsp;Annie got the bowls and the ingredients they would need for the cake. &nbsp;She helped measure the flour, the sugar and the cocoa. &nbsp;Once her mother added the rest of the ingredients, Annie was allowed to stir the ingredients in the bowl. &nbsp;She helped to pour the cake mix into two pans and then put them in the oven. &nbsp;The smell of the cake made Annie hungry. &nbsp;While the cake was baking, Annie helped her mother make the chocolate frosting. &nbsp;Her mother let her lick the spoon when they were done mixing the frosting. &nbsp;Once the cake was done, Annie and her mother took the cake out of the oven and let it cool, and then they frosted it. &nbsp;They ate the chocolate cake at Julia's party with scoops of vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries. &nbsp;Annie gave their dog, Sunny, a little piece of cake too!<\/div><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q46","QuestionID":"QID46"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID195","SecondaryAttribute":"Archer has been responsible for all the following EXCEPT:","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e031180-fb0a-ad74-44f6-6e8a9499bc19\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;

It houses the headquarters for the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited. The building is located at 1 Garden Road, in Central and Western District on Hong Kong Island.Designed by I. M. Pei, the building is high with two masts reaching high. It was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1989 to 1992, and it was the first building outside the United States to break the 305 m (1,000 ft) mark. It is now the third tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, after Two International Finance Centre and Central Plaza.Plot history.The building was initially built by the Hong Kong Branch of the Bank of China; its Garden Road entrance continues to display the name \"Bank of China\", rather than BOCHK. The top four and the bottom 19 stories are used by the Bank, while the other floors are leased out. Ownership has since been transferred to BOCHK, although the Bank of China has leased back several floors for use by its own operations in Hong Kong.Favouritism controversy.The Government had apparently given preferential treatment to Chinese companies, and was again criticised for the apparent preferential treatment to the BOCHK.Design and feng shui.Designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect I. M. Pei, the building is 305.0 metres (1,000.7 ft) high with two masts reaching 367.4 metres (1,205.4 ft) high. The 72 story building is located near Central MTR station. This was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1989 to 1992, the first building outside the United States to break the 305 m (1,000 ft) mark, and the first composite space frame high-rise building. That also means it was the tallest outside America from its completion year, 1990. It is now the third tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, after Two International Finance Center and Central Plaza.A small observation deck on the 43rd floor of the building is open to the public.The structural expressionism adopted in the design of this building resembles growing bamboo shoots, symbolising livelihood and prosperity. The whole structure is supported by the five steel columns at the corners of the building, with the triangular frameworks transferring the weight of the structure onto these five columns. It is covered with glass curtain walls. While its distinctive look makes it one of Hong Kong's most identifiable landmarks today, it was the source of some controversy at one time, as the bank is the only major building in Hong Kong to have bypassed the convention of consulting with feng shui masters on matters of design prior to construction.The building has been criticised by some practitioners of Feng Shui for its sharp edges and its negative symbolism by the numerous 'X' shapes in its original design, though Pei modified the design to some degree before construction following this feedback. The building's profile from some angles resembles that of a meat cleaver. In Feng Shui, this is described as a \"cleaver building\" and it is not difficult to observe that it is facing the HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building in this guise.Cultural references.The BOC Tower's bold futuristic design has made it into popular culture. It is the only Hong Kong landmark included in the city-building\/simulation computer games \"SimCity 3000\" and \"SimCity 4\". The digitally modified facade of the building is featured in the science fiction television series ' as the Starfleet \"Communications Research Center\". The building features alongside the Emirates Towers in the racing game 'Burnout Paradise' In the film, the tower is destroyed by a tornado.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong.The Bank of China Tower (abbreviated BOC Tower) is one of the most...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div>Apollo 1.Apollo 1 is the official name that was retroactively assigned to the never-flown, first manned Apollo program mission, officially designated as AS-204 (Apollo-Saturn), to be launched from Pad 34 (Launch Complex 34, Cape Canaveral, then known as Cape Kennedy) atop a Saturn 1B rocket, on February 21, 1967. The selected crew were: Command Pilot Virgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom, Senior Pilot Ed White and Pilot Roger B. Chaffee.However, during a preliminary test and launch rehearsal on January 27, 1967, a fire broke out in the cabin which killed all three and destroyed the Command Module (CM-012). This was the world's first crew fatality associated with a manned space flight.An Apollo 204 Review Board was quickly launched to determine the cause of the accident. Although the ignition source of the fire was never conclusively identified, the astronauts' deaths were attributed to a wide range of lethal design hazards in the early Apollo Command Module. The manned phase of Apollo was delayed for twenty months while these problems were fixed. The Saturn 1B launch vehicle SA-204 (Saturn\/Apollo) was re-used for the first unmanned Lunar Module test flight, Apollo 5.Mission background.AS-204 was to be the first manned flight of a command and service module (CSM) to Earth orbit, launched on a Saturn 1B. CM-012, the Apollo 1 command module, was a Block I design built for spaceflight but never intended for a trip to the moon since it lacked the needed docking equipment.The AS-204 mission was scheduled for February 21, 1967, having already missed a target date for the last quarter of 1966. The flight was to test \"launch operations, ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly\" and would have lasted up to two weeks, depending on how the spacecraft performed. Grissom resolved to keep AS-204 in orbit for a full 14 days if there was any way to do so.Apollo 1 was intended to be followed by two more Apollo flights in the summer and late autumn of 1967. The first of these would have launched a Block II Apollo CSM on a Saturn 1B along with an unmanned LM on a second Saturn 1B, both ascending to low earth orbit for a CSM-LM rendezvous and docking. The second flight would have launched the CSM and LM together on a Saturn V to high earth orbit. Both of these missions were canceled immediately following the fire.As it turned out, those planned dates proved to be completely unrealistic, since the Saturn V was not ready for its first \"unmanned\" test flight until November 9, 1967, and the LM was not similarly ready until January 22, 1968.The low earth orbit docking was finally achieved using a Saturn V on Apollo 9, launched on March 3, 1969. The high earth orbit mission was deemed unnecessary and cancelled to keep the program on track to a 1969 first lunar landing.Command module design worries.The Apollo Command Module was much bigger and far more complex than any previously implemented spacecraft design. It was built by North American Aviation, which had originally suggested the hatch open outward and carry explosive bolts in case of emergency. NASA didn't agree, arguing the hatch could be accidentally opened (which led to Grissom's \"Liberty Bell 7\" spacecraft sinking during splashdown recovery operations). Before the fire, astronauts successfully lobbied for an outward-opening hatch on future command modules, but NASA subsequently claimed the astronauts were thinking about ease of exit and entry for spacewalks (along with getting out of the CM after splashdown) rather than safety.North American Aviation also suggested the cabin atmosphere be an oxygen\/nitrogen mixture as on the Earth's surface. NASA objected, citing heightened risks such as catastrophic decompression sickness and mismanagement of nitrogen levels, which could cause the astronauts to pass out and die. NASA officials asserted a pure oxygen atmosphere had been used without incident in the Mercury and Gemini programs so it would be safe for use on Apollo. Also, a pure oxygen design saved weight.CM-012 was delivered to NASA with 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes. An additional 623 Engineering Orders were generated subsequent to delivery. The crew expressed serious concerns about fire hazards and other problems (Grissom even famously took a lemon from a tree by his house, telling his wife Betty, \"I'm going to hang it on that spacecraft\").The January 27, 1967 launch simulation, officially considered not hazardous because the Saturn 1B was not loaded with fuel, was a \"plugs-out\" test to determine whether the spacecraft would operate nominally on internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals. There was hope that if the spacecraft passed this and subsequent tests, it would be ready to fly on February 21, 1967.In a BBC documentary \"NASA: Triumph and Tragedy\", Jim McDivitt said that NASA had no idea how 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in a documentary \"In the Shadow of the Moon.\"Plugs-out test.At 1:00 PM (1800 GMT) on January 27 Grissom, White and Chaffee entered the command module fully suited, were strapped into their seats and hooked up to the spacecraft's systems in preparation for the plugs-out test. There were immediate problems. A sour \"buttermilk\" smell in the air circulating through Grissom's suit delayed the launch simulation until 2:42 PM. Three minutes later the hatch was sealed and high-pressure pure oxygen began replacing the air in the cabin.Further problems included episodes of high oxygen flow apparently linked to movements by the astronauts in their flightsuits. There were also faulty communications between the crew, the control room, the operations and checkout building and the complex 34 blockhouse. \"How are we going to get to the moon if we can't talk between three buildings?\" Grissom complained in frustration over the communication loop. This put the launch simulation on hold again at 5:40. Most countdown functions had been successfully completed by 6:20 but the countdown was still holding at T minus 10 minutes at 6:30 with all cables and umbilicals still attached to the command module while attempts were made to fix the communication problem.Fire.The crew members were reclining in their horizontal couches, running through a checklist when a voltage transient was recorded at 6:30:54 (23:30:54 GMT). Ten seconds later (at 6:31:04) Chaffee said, \"Hey...\" Scuffling sounds followed for three seconds before Grissom shouted \"Fire!\" Chaffee then reported, \"We've got a fire in the cockpit,\" and White said \"Fire in the cockpit!\"After nearly ten seconds of frenetic movement noises Chaffee yelled, \"We've got a bad fire! Let's get out! We're burning up! We're on fire! Get us out of here!\" Some witnesses said they saw Ed White on the television monitors, reaching for the hatch release handle as flames in the cabin spread from left to right and licked the window. Only 17 seconds after the first indication by crew of any fire, the transmission ended abruptly at 6:31:21 with a scream of pain as the cabin ruptured after rapidly expanding gases from the fire overpressurized the CM to 29 psi (200 kPa).Intense heat, dense toxic smoke, malfunctioning gas masks and shock waves and explosions from the cabin hampered the ground crew's rescue efforts. There were fears the fire might ignite the solid fuel rockets in the launch escape tower above the command module, likely killing nearby ground personnel. It took five minutes to open the inner and outer hatches, a set of three with many ratchets. By this time the fire in the command module had gone out. Although the cabin lights remained lit the ground crew was at first unable to find the astronauts. As the smoke cleared they found the bodies but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted the astronauts' nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom's body was found lying mostly on the deck. His and White's suits were fused together. The body of Ed White (whom mission protocol had tasked with opening the hatch) was lying back in his center couch. White would not have been able to open the inward-opening hatch against the internal pressure. Chaffee's job was to shut down the spacecraft systems and maintain communications with ground control. His body was still strapped into the right-hand seat.Aftermath.According to the Apollo 204 Review Board, Grissom suffered severe third degree burns on over a third of his body and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over almost a quarter of his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. It was later confirmed the crew had died of smoke inhalation with burns contributing. In later lawsuits brought by Gus Grissom's widow Betty Grissom there were claims the astronauts had lived longer than NASA claimed publicly.The review board found the documentation for CM-012 so lacking that they were at times unable to determine what had been installed in the spacecraft or what was in it at the time of the accident.Cause.Since the CM was designed to endure outward pressure in the vacuum of space, the plugs-out test had been run with the cabin pressure at over 16 psi, almost 2 psi above the ambient sea level pressure at Launch Complex 34 and near the upper limits of measuring devices in the spacecraft. This represented over 5 times the oxygen density carried within the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft while in spaceflight (which was only 3 psi but equal to the partial pressure of oxygen at sea level and thus very breathable). Following a worldwide survey of artificial oxygen-rich environments, it was found that rarely if ever had a 100% oxygen environment been created and maintained at such a high pressure, in which a bar of aluminum can burn like wood. The investigation also found much substandard wiring and plumbing in the craft along with a misplaced socket wrench. (which was ruled out as a cause). Hence, the fire was at first believed to have been caused by a spark somewhere in the over of wiring threaded throughout the command module.The review board noted a silver-plated copper wire running through an environmental control unit near the command module pilot's couch had become stripped of its Teflon insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of a small access door. This weak point in the wiring also ran near a junction in an ethylene glycol\/water cooling line which was known to be prone to leaks. The electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the silver anode was a notable hazard which could cause a violent exothermic reaction, igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the CM's corrosive test atmosphere of pure, high-pressure oxygen.The panel cited how the NASA crew systems department had installed of fuzzy Velcro throughout the spacecraft, almost like carpeting. This velcro was found to be explosive in a high-pressure 100% oxygen environment. Up to 70 pounds of other non-metallic flammable materials had crept into the design. Buzz Aldrin in \"Men From Earth\" states that the three astronauts complained that they wanted the flammable material removed, and that there was to be no flammable material in the spacecraft; the flammable material was removed, but was replaced prior to delivery to Cape Kennedy.In 1968 a team of MIT physicists went to Cape Kennedy and performed a static discharge test in the CM-103 command module while it was being prepared for the launch of Apollo 8. With an electroscope, they measured the approximate energy of static discharges caused by a test crew dressed in nylon flight pressure suits and reclining on the nylon flight seats. The MIT investigators found sufficient energy for ignition discharged repeatedly when crew-members shifted in their seats and then touched the spacecraft's aluminum panels.However, the ignition source for the Apollo 1 fire was never officially determined.Command module redesign.Thorough protocols were implemented for documenting spacecraft construction and maintenance. By all accounts the design changes were successful and justified the 21-month delay of the first manned mission, Apollo 7.1961 Soviet oxygen fire.In March 1961 Soviet cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko died after a fire that started in a high-oxygen isolation chamber. The USSR concealed the tragedy for over 20 years, which subsequently caused some speculation as to whether or not the \"Apollo 1\" disaster might have been averted had NASA been aware of the incident. However, the fire hazards of a 100%-oxygen sea-level pressure environment had been well described by 1967 and many deaths from flash fires had been publicly reported during the 1950s and 1960s. A 1966 editorial in the journal \"Space\/Aeronautics\" asserted \"The odds are that the first spaceflight casualty due to environmental exposure will occur not in space, but on the ground\", and further noted that safety protocols for the Apollo project were thoroughly lacking.Scapegoats.In May 1967, some U.S. Congressmen questioned NASA's selection of North American Aviation as the prime contractor for Apollo. On May 11, NASA Administrator James E. Webb issued a statement defending the selection. On June 9, Deputy Director Robert C. Seamans, Jr. filed a seven-page memorandum documenting the process that led to North American's selection in November 1961.Internally, some acrimony developed between NASA and North American over assignment of blame. North American argued unsuccessfully that it was not responsible for the fatal error in spacecraft atmosphere design. Finally, Webb contacted North American president Lee Atwood, and demanded that either he or Chief Engineer Harrison \"Stormy\" Storms resign. Atwood elected to fire Storms.On the NASA side, Joe Shea, manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, became unfit for duty in the aftermath and was removed from his position, although not fired.Mission insignia.The \"Apollo 1\" insignia has a center showing a command service module flying over the southeastern United States with Florida (the launch point) prominent. The moon is seen in the distance, symbolic of the eventual program goal. A yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes, trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by the crew, with the artwork done by Allen Stevens of Rockwell International.Memorials.Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Ed White was buried at the cemetery of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Their names are also enshrined on the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida.An Apollo 1 mission patch was left on the moon's surface during the first manned lunar landing by Apollo 11.Launch Complex 34.Launch Complex 34 was subsequently used only for the launch of Apollo 7 and later dismantled but the launch platform remains at the site () along with a few other concrete and steel-reinforced structures. The launch platform bears two plaques noting the tragedy.One reads: \"LAUNCH COMPLEX 34, Friday, 27 January 1967, 1831 Hours. Dedicated to the living memory of the crew of the Apollo 1: USAF. Lt. Colonel Virgil I. Grissom, USAF. Lt. Colonel Edward H. White, II, U.S.N. Lt. Commander Roger B. Chaffee. They gave their lives in service to their country in the ongoing exploration of humankind's final frontier. Remember them not for how they died but for those ideals for which they lived.\"The other reads: \"In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice so others could reach for the stars; Ad astra per aspera (a rough road leads to the stars); God speed to the crew of Apollo 1\"In January 2005 three granite benches built by a college classmate of one of the astronauts, one for each member of the crew, were installed at the site.Each year the families of the Apollo 1 crew are invited to the site for a memorial, and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center offers a visit to the site for those who choose to take a special tour to the older launch sites on Cape Canaveral.Naming of Apollo 1.When North American Aviation shipped spacecraft CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center it bore a banner proclaiming it as \"Apollo One\". Grissom's crew had received approval for an \"Apollo 1\" patch in June 1966 but NASA was planning to call the mission \"AS-204.\" After the fire, the astronauts' widows asked that \"Apollo 1\" be reserved for the flight their husbands never made.Apollo 1's (AS-204) Saturn IB rocket was taken down from Launch Complex 34, later reassembled at Launch Complex 37B and used to launch the \"Apollo 5\" LM-1 into earth orbit for the first Lunar Module test mission.Effect on early Apollo mission names.For a time mission planners called the next scheduled launch \"Apollo 2\". There were also suggestions the first Apollo CSM flights be named wholly out of chronological sequence as \"Apollo 1\" (AS-204), \"Apollo 1A\" (AS-201), \"Apollo 2\" (AS-202) and \"Apollo 3\" (AS-203) but the NASA project designation committee decided on \"Apollo 4\" for the first (unmanned) Apollo-Saturn V mission (AS-501), with no retroactive renaming of earlier missions. Hence, AS-203 is now sometimes informally (and chronologically) referred to as \"Apollo 2\" and likewise, AS-202 as \"Apollo 3\".Remains of CM-012.The \"Apollo 1\" command module has never been on public display. After the accident the burned-out spacecraft was removed and taken to Kennedy Space Center to be studied for any information that might prevent a recurrence of the tragedy. It was then moved to the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia and placed in a secured storage warehouse. On February 17, 2007 the wreckage of CM-012 was moved approximately to a newer, environmentally-controlled warehouse. Only a few weeks earlier Gus Grissom's brother Lowell publicly suggested CM-012 be permanently entombed in the concrete remains of Launch Complex 34.<\/div><div><br><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q50","QuestionID":"QID50"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID201","SecondaryAttribute":"Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong.The Bank of China Tower (abbreviated BOC Tower) is one of the most...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong.The Bank of China Tower (abbreviated BOC Tower) is one of the most recognisable skyscrapers in Central, Hong Kong.

Cajun cuisine heavily relied on game meats supplemented with rice or corn. Other than African cuisine, French, Spanish and Native American culinary influences can also be detected in Cajun food. Another feature of the cuisine was the frequent use of smoked meats. Smoked meats are a common aspect of many Cajun dishes.Deep-frying of turkeys or oven-roasted turduckens entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, blackening of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine.Cajun ingredients.The following is a partial list of ingredients used in Cajun cuisine and some of the staple ingredients of the Acadian food culture.Meat and seafood.Cajun folkways include many ways of preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and mass-produced meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or duck confit (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.Game (and hunting) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.The recent increase of catfish farming in the Mississippi Delta has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in the place of the more traditional wild-caught trout (the saltwater species) and redfish.Also included in the seafood mix are some so-called \"trash fish\" that would not sell at market because of their high bone to meat ratio or required complicated cooking methods. These were brought home by fishermen to feed the family. Examples are garfish, black drum also called gaspergou or just \"goo\", croaker, and bream.Though parts of Acadiana are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Cajun form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the southern US, although seasoned differently.Dairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are no unique dairy items prepared in Cajun cuisine. Traditional southern US and New Orleans influenced desserts are common.Cajun dishes.Primary favorites.Boudin (sometimes spelled \"boudain\" in Texas) is a type of sausage made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic and green onion, and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. Boudin is usually made daily as it does not keep well for very long, even frozen. Boudin is typically stuffed in a natural casing and has a softer consistency than other, better-known sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, maque choux, or bread.High on the list of favorites of Cajun cooking are the soups called gumbos. Gumbo exemplifies the influence of African and Native American food cultures on Cajun cuisine. The word originally meant \"okra\", which is a word brought to the region from western Africa. Okra, which is a principal ingredient of many gumbo recipes, is used as a thickening agent and for its distinct vegetable flavor.Another classic Cajun dish is jambalaya. The only certain thing that can be said about a jambalaya is that it contains rice and almost anything else. Usually, however, one will find green peppers, onions, celery and hot chile peppers. Anything else is optional.Food as an event.The crawfish boil is a celebratory event where Cajuns boil crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn over large propane cookers. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper and other spices, commonly known as \"crab boil\" or \"crawfish boil\" are added to the water for seasoning. The results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in spice blends, such as Zatarain's, Louisiana Fish Fry or Tony Chachere's. Also, Cocktail sauce, mayonnaise and hot sauce sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand.

Cajun cuisine heavily relied on game meats supplemented with rice or corn. Other than African cuisine, French, Spanish and Native American culinary influences can also be detected in Cajun food. Another feature of the cuisine was the frequent use of smoked meats. Smoked meats are a common aspect of many Cajun dishes.Deep-frying of turkeys or oven-roasted turduckens entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, blackening of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine.Cajun ingredients.The following is a partial list of ingredients used in Cajun cuisine and some of the staple ingredients of the Acadian food culture.Meat and seafood.Cajun folkways include many ways of preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and mass-produced meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or duck confit (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.Game (and hunting) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.The recent increase of catfish farming in the Mississippi Delta has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in the place of the more traditional wild-caught trout (the saltwater species) and redfish.Also included in the seafood mix are some so-called \"trash fish\" that would not sell at market because of their high bone to meat ratio or required complicated cooking methods. These were brought home by fishermen to feed the family. Examples are garfish, black drum also called gaspergou or just \"goo\", croaker, and bream.Though parts of Acadiana are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Cajun form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the southern US, although seasoned differently.Dairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are no unique dairy items prepared in Cajun cuisine. Traditional southern US and New Orleans influenced desserts are common.Cajun dishes.Primary favorites.Boudin (sometimes spelled \"boudain\" in Texas) is a type of sausage made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic and green onion, and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. Boudin is usually made daily as it does not keep well for very long, even frozen. Boudin is typically stuffed in a natural casing and has a softer consistency than other, better-known sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, maque choux, or bread.High on the list of favorites of Cajun cooking are the soups called gumbos. Gumbo exemplifies the influence of African and Native American food cultures on Cajun cuisine. The word originally meant \"okra\", which is a word brought to the region from western Africa. Okra, which is a principal ingredient of many gumbo recipes, is used as a thickening agent and for its distinct vegetable flavor.Another classic Cajun dish is jambalaya. The only certain thing that can be said about a jambalaya is that it contains rice and almost anything else. Usually, however, one will find green peppers, onions, celery and hot chile peppers. Anything else is optional.Food as an event.The crawfish boil is a celebratory event where Cajuns boil crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn over large propane cookers. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper and other spices, commonly known as \"crab boil\" or \"crawfish boil\" are added to the water for seasoning. The results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in spice blends, such as Zatarain's, Louisiana Fish Fry or Tony Chachere's. Also, Cocktail sauce, mayonnaise and hot sauce sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand. During times when crawfish are not abundant, shrimp and crabs are prepared and served in the same manner.Attendees are encouraged to \"suck the head\" of a crawfish by separating the abdomen of the crustacean and sucking out the abdominal fat\/juices.

It supports the principles of noninterference in the affairs of third world countries and increased assistance to underdeveloped countries. Cameroon is an active participant in the United Nations, where its voting record demonstrates its commitment to causes that include international peacekeeping, the rule of law, environmental protection, and Third World economic development. In the UN and other human rights fora, Cameroon's non-confrontational approach has generally led it to avoid criticizing other countries.Cameroon enjoys good relations with the United States and other developed countries. Cameroon enjoys generally good relations with its African neighbors. It supports UN peacekeeping activities in Central Africa.International Disputes.Delimitation of international boundaries in the vicinity of Lake Chad, the lack of which led to border incidents in the past, is complete and awaits ratification by Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria; dispute with Nigeria over land and maritime boundaries around the Bakasi Peninsula and Lake Chad is currently before the ICJ, as is a dispute with Equatorial Guinea over the exclusive maritime economic zone.Cameroon also faces a complaint filed with the African Commission on Human Rights by the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC) and the Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation (SCAPO) against the Government of the Republic of Cameroon, in which the complainants allege that the Republic of Cameroon is illegally occupying the territory of Southern Cameroons. The SCNC and SCAPO ultimately seek the independence of the territory of Southern Cameroons.. As of 2008, both parties have submitted briefs and responded to the Human Rights Commissions' inquiries. A ruling by the African Commission on Human Rights is awaited.Bilateral relationships.Cameroon maintains significant bilateral relations with several countries.People's Republic of China.The People's Republic of China has a number of health and infrastructure projects underway in Cameroon.In January 2007,China signed a series of economic agreements with Cameroon, giving more than $54 million in loans.Equatorial Guinea.Cameroon has a dispute with Equatorial Guinea over the exclusive maritime economic zone, which is currently before the ICJ. They also have a dispute over an island at the mouth of the Ntem River.France.Cameroon has particularly close ties with France, with whom it has numerous military, economic, and cultural agreements.Nigeria.Cameroon is engaged in a sporadic armed conflict with Nigeria in the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula. Cameroon has repeatedly demonstrated its preference for resolving this conflict through peaceful legal means and has submitted its case to the International Court of Justice. The two countries agree on maritime delimitation.Russia.United States.The bilateral U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) program in Cameroon closed for budgetary reasons in 1994.Canada.Cameroon and Canada have established diplomatic ties since 1962 with three agreements and four protocoles signed in 1965.

At present the only family retained in the order is the storks, Ciconiidae.Taxonomic issues with Ciconiiformes.Following the development of research techniques in molecular biology in the late 20th century, in particular methods for studying DNA-DNA hybridisation, a great deal of new information has surfaced, much of it suggesting that many birds, although looking very different from one another, are in fact more closely related than was previously thought. Accordingly, the radical and influential Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy greatly enlarged the Ciconiiformes, adding many more families, including most of those usually regarded as belonging to the Sphenisciformes (penguins), Gaviiformes (divers), Podicipediformes (grebes), Procellariiformes (tubenosed seabirds), Charadriiformes, (waders, gulls, terns and auks), Pelecaniformes (pelicans, cormorants, gannets and allies), and the Falconiformes (diurnal birds of prey). The flamingo family, Phoenicopteridae, is related, and is sometimes classed as part of the Ciconiiformes.However, morphological evidence suggests that the traditional Ciconiiformes should be split between two lineages, rather than expanded, although some non-traditional Ciconiiformes may be included in these two lineages.The exact taxonomic placement of New World Vultures remains unclear.

When first infected, a person can develop an \u00d2acute\u00d3 infection, which can range in severity from a very mild illness with few or no symptoms to a serious condition requiring hospitalization. Acute Hepatitis B refers to the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis B virus. Some people are able to fight the infection and clear the virus. For others, the infection remains and leads to a \u00d2chronic,\u00d3 or lifelong, illness. Chronic Hepatitis B refers to the illness that occurs when the Hepatitis B virus remains in a person\u00d5s body.

Ciconiiformes are known from the Late Eocene. At present the only family retained in the order is the storks, Ciconiidae.Taxonomic issues with Ciconiiformes.Following the development of research techniques in molecular biology in the late 20th century, in particular methods for studying DNA-DNA hybridisation, a great deal of new information has surfaced, much of it suggesting that many birds, although looking very different from one another, are in fact more closely related than was previously thought. Accordingly, the radical and influential Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy greatly enlarged the Ciconiiformes, adding many more families, including most of those usually regarded as belonging to the Sphenisciformes (penguins), Gaviiformes (divers), Podicipediformes (grebes), Procellariiformes (tubenosed seabirds), Charadriiformes, (waders, gulls, terns and auks), Pelecaniformes (pelicans, cormorants, gannets and allies), and the Falconiformes (diurnal birds of prey). The flamingo family, Phoenicopteridae, is related, and is sometimes classed as part of the Ciconiiformes.However, morphological evidence suggests that the traditional Ciconiiformes should be split between two lineages, rather than expanded, although some non-traditional Ciconiiformes may be included in these two lineages.The exact taxonomic placement of New World Vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World Vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world and are not closely related. Just how different the two families are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures belong in Ciconiiformes. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World Vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World Vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in \"Incertae sedis\", but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.Some official bodies have adopted the proposed Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy almost entirely, however a more common approach worldwide has been to retain the traditional groupings, and modify rather than replace them in the light of new evidence as it comes to hand. The family listing here follows this more conservative practice. Bird taxonomy has been in a state of flux for some years, and it is reasonable to expect that the large differences between different classification schemes will continue to gradually resolve themselves as more evidence becomes available.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q70","QuestionID":"QID70"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID221","SecondaryAttribute":"Common Gateway Interface.The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol that defines h...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Common Gateway Interface.The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol that defines how webserver software can delegate the generation of webpages to a console application.

The overhead involved in process creation can be reduced by solutions such as FastCGI, or by running the application code entirely within the webserver using special extension modules.Alternatives.The optimal configuration for any web application depends on application-specific details, amount of traffic, and complexity of the transaction; these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q229","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Common Gateway Interface.The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol that defines h...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID229"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID458","SecondaryAttribute":"Cover of NIMH brochure Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: When Unwanted Thoughts Take Over, including...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<p>Cover of NIMH brochure Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: When Unwanted Thoughts Take Over, including image of abstract painting\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder:  When  Unwanted Thoughts Take  Over \nDo you feel the need to check and re check things over and over?

For example, you might double check to make sure the stove or iron is turned off before leaving the house. But people with OCD feel the need to check things repeatedly, or have certain thoughts or perform routines and rituals over and over.The thoughts and rituals associated with OCD cause distress and get in the way of daily life. \nThe frequent upsetting thoughts are called obsessions.To try to control them, a person will feel an overwhelming urge to repeat certain rituals or behaviors called compulsions. People with OCD can\u2019t control these obsessions and compulsions. \nFor many people, OCD starts during childhood or the teen years. Most people are diagnosed by about age 19. Symptoms of OCD may come and go and be better or worse at different times. \n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of OCD? \nPeople with OCD generally: \nHave repeated thoughts or images about many different things, such as fear of germs, dirt, or intruders; acts of violence; hurting loved ones; sexual acts; conflicts with religious beliefs; or being overly tidy \n\nDo the same rituals over and over such as washing hands, locking and unlocking doors, counting, keeping unneeded items, or repeating the same steps again and again \n\nCan\u2019t control the unwanted thoughts and behaviors \n\nDon\u2019t get pleasure when performing the behaviors or rituals, but get brief relief from the anxiety the thoughts cause \n\nSpend at least 1 hour a day on the thoughts and rituals, which cause distress and get in the way of daily life. \n\n\n\nWhat causes OCD? \nOCD sometimes runs in families, but no one knows for sure why some people have it, while others don\u2019t. Researchers have found that several parts of the brain are involved in fear and anxiety. By learning more about fear and anxiety in the brain, scientists may be able to create better treatments. Researchers are also looking for ways in which stress and environmental factors may play a role. \n\nHow is OCD treated? \nFirst, talk to your doctor about your symptoms. Your doctor should do an exam to make sure that another physical problem isn\u2019t causing the symptoms.The doctor may refer you to a mental health specialist. \nOCD is generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both. \nPsychotherapy. A type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavior therapy is especially useful for treating OCD. It teaches a person different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations that help him or her feel less anxious or fearful without having obsessive thoughts or acting compulsively. One type of therapy called exposure and response prevention is especially helpful in reducing compulsive behaviors in OCD. \nDetail of cover image of abstract painting\n\nMedication. Doctors also may prescribe medication to help treat OCD.The most commonly prescribed medications for OCD are anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants. Anti-anxiety medications are powerful and there are different types. Many types begin working right away, but they generally should not be taken for long periods. \nAntidepressants are used to treat depression, but they are also particularly helpful for OCD, probably more so than anti-anxiety medications. They may take several weeks\u201410 to 12 weeks for some\u2014to start working. Some of these medications may cause side effects such as headache, nausea, or difficulty sleeping.These side effects are usually not a problem for most people, especially if the dose starts off low and is increased slowly over time. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you may have. \nIt\u2019s important to know that although antidepres.sants can be safe and effective for many people, they may be risky for some, especially children, teens, and young adults.A \u201cblack box\u201d\u2014the most serious type of warning that a prescription drug can have\u2014has been added to the labels of anti.depressant medications.These labels warn people that antidepressants may cause some people to have suicidal thoughts or make suicide attempts. Anyone taking antidepressants should be moni.tored closely, especially when they first start treat.ment with medications. \nSome people with OCD do better with cognitive behavior therapy, especially exposure and response prevention. Others do better with medication. Still others do best with a combination of the two.Talk with your doctor about the best treatment for you. \n\nWhat  is  it  like  having  OCD? \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything without rituals. They invaded every aspect of my life. Counting really bogged me down. I would wash my hair three times as opposed to once because three was a good luck number and one wasn\u2019t. It took me longer to read because I\u2019d count the lines in a paragraph. When I set my alarm at night, I had to set it to a number that wouldn\u2019t add up to a \u2018bad\u2019 number.\u201d \n\u201cGetting dressed in the morning was tough, because I had a routine, and if I didn\u2019t follow the routine, I\u2019d get anxious and would have to get dressed again. I always worried that if I didn\u2019t do something, my parents were going to die. I\u2019d have these terrible thoughts of harming my parents. I knew that was completely irrational, but the thoughts triggered more anxiety and more senseless behavior. Because of the time I spent on rituals, I was unable to do a lot of things that were important to me.\u201d \n\u201cI knew the rituals didn\u2019t make sense, and I was deeply ashamed of them, but I couldn\u2019t seem to overcome them until I got treatment.\u201d \n\nNational Institute of Mental Health logo\nContact us to find out more about Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. \nNational Institute of Mental Health \nScience Writing, Press &amp; Dissemination Branch 6001 Executive Boulevard Room 8184, MSC 9663 Bethesda, MD 20892-9663 Phone: 301-443-4513 or  1-866-615-NIMH (6464) toll-free TTY: 301-443-8431 or  1-866-415-8051 toll-free E-mail: nimhinfo@nih.gov Website: www.nimh.nih.gov \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services logo\nNational Institutes of Health logo\nU.S. Department of HealtH anD HUman ServiceS national institutes of Health niH publication no. tr 10-4676 revised 2010 <\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q458","QuestionID":"QID458","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Cover of NIMH brochure Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: When Unwanted Thoughts Take Over, including...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID122","SecondaryAttribute":"Critical psychology.Critical psychology is a branch of psychology that takes a critical theory ba...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Critical psychology.Critical psychology is a branch of psychology that takes a critical theory based perspective. Critical psychology is aimed at critiquing mainstream psychology and which attempts to apply psychology in more progressive ways, often looking towards social change as a means of preventing and treating psychopathology.One of Critical Psychology's main criticisms of conventional psychology is how it fails to consider or deliberately ignores the way power differences between social classes and groups can impact the mental and physical well-being of individuals or groups of people.Origins.Klaus Holzkamp.One of the most important and sophisticated books in the field is the \"Grundlegung der Psychologie\" (\"Foundations of Psychology\") by Klaus Holzkamp, who might be considered the theoretical founder of critical psychology. Holzkamp, who had written 2 books on theory of science and one on sensory perception before publishing the \"Grundlegung der Psychologie\" in 1983, thought this major work provided a solid paradigm for psychological research, as he viewed psychology as a pre-paradigmatic scientific discipline (T.S. Kuhn had used the term \"pre-paradigmatic\" for social science).One core result of Holzkamp's historical and comparative analysis of human reproductive action, perception and cognition is a very specific concept of meaning that identifies symbolical meaning as historically and culturally constructed, purposeful conceptual structures that humans create in close relationship to material culture and within the context of historically specific formations of social reproduction.Coming from this phenomenological perspective on culturally mediated and socially situated action, Holzkamp launched a devastating and original methodological attack on behaviorism (which he termed S-R (stimulus-response) psychology) based on linguistic analysis, showing in minute detail the rhetorical patterns by which this approach to psychology creates the illusion of \"scientific objectivity\" while at the same time losing relevance for understanding culturally situated, intentional human actions. Against this approach, he developed his own approach to generalization and objectivity, drawing on ideas from Kurt Lewin in Chapter 9 of \"Grundlegung der Psychologie\".His last major publication before his death in 1995 was about learning. It appeared in 1993 and contained a phenomenological theory of learning from the standpoint of the subject. One important concept Holzkamp developed was \"reinterpretation\" of theories developed by conventional psychology. This meant to look at these concepts from the standpoint of the paradigm of critical psychology, thereby integrating their useful insights into critical psychology while at the same time identifying and criticizing their limiting implications while (which in the case of S-R-psychology were the rhetorical elimination of the subject and intentional action, and in the case of cognitive psychology which did take into account subjective motives and intentional actions, methodological individualism). The first part of the book thus contains an extensive look at the history of psychological theories of learning and a minute re-interpretation of those concepts from the perspective of the paradigm of critical psychology, which focuses on intentional action situated in specific socio-historical\/cultural contexts. The conceptions of learning he found most useful in his own detailed analysis of \"classroom learning\" came from cognitive anthropologists Jean Lave (situated learning) and Edwin Hutchins (distributed cognition). The book's second part contained an extensive analysis on the modern state's institutionalized forms of \"classroom learning\" as the cultural-historical context that shapes much of modern learning and socialization. In this analysis, he heavily drew upon Michel Foucault's \"Discipline and Punish\". Holzkamp felt that classroom learning as the historically specific form of learning does not make full use of student's potentials, but rather limits her or his learning potentials by a number of \"teaching strategies.\" Part of his motivation for the book was to look for alternative forms of learning that made use of the enormous potential of the human psyche in more fruitful ways. Consequently, in the last section of the book, Holzkamp discusses forms of \"expansive learning\" that seem to avoid the limitations of classroom learning, such as apprenticeship and learning in contexts other than classrooms.This search culminated in plans to write a major work on life leadership in the specific historical context of modern (capitalist) society. Due to his death in 1995, this work never got past the stage of early (and premature) conceptualizations, some of which were published in the journals \"Forum Kritische Psychologie\" and \"Argument\".1960 through 1970.In the 1960s and 1970s the term \"radical psychology\" was used by psychologists to denote a branch of the field which rejected conventional psychology's focus on the individual as the basic unit of analysis and sole source of psychopathology. Instead, radical psychologists examined the role of society in causing and treating problems and looked towards social change as an alternative to therapy to treat mental illness and as a means of preventing psychopathology. Within psychiatry the term \"anti-psychiatry\" was often used and now British activists prefer the term \"critical psychiatry\". \"Critical Psychology\" is currently the preferred term for the discipline of psychology keen to find alternatives to the way the discipline of psychology reduces human experience to the level of the individual and thereby strips away possibilities for radical social change.In the 1990s.Starting in the 1990s a new wave of books started to appear on critical psychology, the most influential being the edited book \"Critical Psychology\" by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky. Various introductory texts to critical psychology written in the United Kingdom have tended to focus on discourse, but this has been seen by some proponents of critical psychology as a reduction of human experience to language which is as politically dangerous as the way mainstream psychology reduces experience to the individual mind.Critical Psychology today.There are a few international journals devoted to critical psychology, including the International Journal of Critical Psychology (no longer published) and the Annual Review of Critical Psychology. The journals still tend to be directed to an academic audience, though the Annual Review of Critical Psychology runs as an open-access online journal. There are close links between critical psychologists and critical psychiatrists in Britain through the. Critical psychology courses and research concentrations are available at, the, the and the and the University of AucklandCriticisms of conventional psychology.One of the criticisms of conventional psychology raised by critical psychology is the inattention to power differentials between different groups - examples include between psychiatrists and patients, psychologists and clients, wealthy groups and the less financially well-off, or industrial lobbyists and the general public. This inattention to power has resulted in conventional psychology tending to assume that how things are is how they should be, that the current state of affairs is the natural state of things. As a result, conventional psychology has a tendency to uphold the status quo, blame the victim, and situate problems within individuals rather than the social context they are embedded in.Extensions.Like many critical applications, critical psychology has expanded beyond Marxist roots to benefit from other critical approaches. Consider ecopsychology and transpersonal psychology. Critical psychology and related work has also sometimes been labelled radical psychology and liberation psychology. In the field of developmental psychology, the work of Erica Burman has been influential.Various sub-disciplines within psychology have begun to establish their own critical orientations. Perhaps the most extensive are Critical Health Psychology and Community Psychology.Germany.At FU-Berlin, critical psychology was not really seen as a division of psychology and followed its own methodology, trying to reformulate traditional psychology on an unorthodox Marxist base and drawing from Soviet ideas of cultural-historical psychology, particularly Aleksey Leontyev. Some years ago the department of critical psychology at the FU-Berlin was merged into the traditional psychology department.An (edited by Desmond Painter, Athanasios Marvakis, and Leendert Mos) is devoted to an examination of German Critical Psychology.South Africa.The University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa, is one of few worldwide to offer a. For an overview of critical psychology in South Africa, see Desmond Painter and Martin Terre Blanche's article on. They have also now started a.United States and Canada.Critical psychology in the United States and Canada has, for the most part, focused on critiques of mainstream psychology's support for an unjust \"status quo\". No departments of critical psychology exist, though critical perspectives are sometimes encountered in traditional universities, perhaps especially within. North American efforts include the 1993 founding of RadPsyNet, the 1997 publication of (edited by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky), and the action-focused (Psychologists Acting with Conscience Together).<\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Critical psychology.Critical psychology is a branch of psychology that takes a critical theory ba...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div><div>All of Larry's friends have a favorite animal.

Codd, the inventor of the relational model, introduced the concept of normalization and what we now know as the First Normal Form (1NF) in 1970. Codd went on to define the Second Normal Form (2NF) and Third Normal Form (3NF) in 1971, and Codd and Raymond F. Boyce defined the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) in 1974. Higher normal forms were defined by other theorists in subsequent years, the most recent being the Sixth normal form (6NF) introduced by Chris Date, Hugh Darwen, and Nikos Lorentzos in 2002.Informally, a relational database table (the computerized representation of a relation) is often described as \"normalized\" if it is in the Third Normal Form. Most 3NF tables are free of insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, i.e. in most cases 3NF tables adhere to BCNF, 4NF, and 5NF (but typically not 6NF).A standard piece of database design guidance is that the designer should create a fully normalized design; selective denormalization can subsequently be performed for performance reasons. However, some modeling disciplines, such as the dimensional modeling approach to data warehouse design, explicitly recommend non-normalized designs, i.e. designs that in large part do not adhere to 3NF.Objectives of normalization.For example, in order to find out the monetary sum of all transactions that occurred in October 2003 for all customers, the system would have to know that it must first unpack the \"Transactions\" group of each customer, then sum the \"Amounts\" of all transactions thus obtained where the \"Date\" of the transaction falls in October 2003.Now each row represents an individual credit card transaction, and the DBMS can obtain the answer of interest, simply by finding all rows with a Date falling in October, and summing their Amounts. All of the values in the data structure are on an equal footing: they are all exposed to the DBMS directly, and can directly participate in queries, whereas in the previous situation some values were embedded in lower-level structures that had to be handled specially. Accordingly, the normalized design lends itself to general-purpose query processing, whereas the unnormalized design does not.The sections below give details of each of these objectives.Minimize redesign when extending the database structure.When a fully normalized database structure is extended to allow it to accommodate new types of data, the pre-existing aspects of the database structure can remain largely or entirely unchanged. As a result, applications interacting with the database are minimally affected.Make the data model more informative to users.Normalized tables, and the relationship between one normalized table and another, mirror real-world concepts and their interrelationships.Avoid bias towards any particular pattern of querying.Normalized tables are suitable for general-purpose querying. This means any queries against these tables, including future queries whose details cannot be anticipated, are supported. In contrast, tables that are not normalized lend themselves to some types of queries, but not others.Background to normalization: definitions.Normal forms.The normal forms (abbrev. NF) of relational database theory provide criteria for determining a table's degree of vulnerability to logical inconsistencies and anomalies. The higher the normal form applicable to a table, the less vulnerable it is to inconsistencies and anomalies. Each table has a \"highest normal form\" (HNF): by definition, a table always meets the requirements of its HNF and of all normal forms lower than its HNF; also by definition, a table fails to meet the requirements of any normal form higher than its HNF.The normal forms are applicable to individual tables; to say that an entire database is in normal form \"n\" is to say that all of its tables are in normal form \"n\".Newcomers to database design sometimes suppose that normalization proceeds in an iterative fashion, i.e. a 1NF design is first normalized to 2NF, then to 3NF, and so on. This is not an accurate description of how normalization typically works. A sensibly designed table is likely to be in 3NF on the first attempt; furthermore, if it is 3NF, it is overwhelmingly likely to have an HNF of 5NF. Achieving the \"higher\" normal forms (above 3NF) does not usually require an extra expenditure of effort on the part of the designer, because 3NF tables usually need no modification to meet the requirements of these higher normal forms.The main normal forms are summarized below.Denormalization.Databases intended for online transaction processing (OLTP) are typically more normalized than databases intended for online analytical processing (OLAP). OLTP applications are characterized by a high volume of small transactions such as updating a sales record at a supermarket checkout counter. The expectation is that each transaction will leave the database in a consistent state. By contrast, databases intended for OLAP operations are primarily \"read mostly\" databases. OLAP applications tend to extract historical data that has accumulated over a long period of time. For such databases, redundant or \"denormalized\" data may facilitate business intelligence applications. Specifically, dimensional tables in a star schema often contain denormalized data. The denormalized or redundant data must be carefully controlled during extract, transform, load (ETL) processing, and users should not be permitted to see the data until it is in a consistent state. The normalized alternative to the star schema is the snowflake schema. In many cases, the need for denormalization has waned as computers and RDBMS software have become more powerful, but since data volumes have generally increased along with hardware and software performance, OLAP databases often still use denormalized schemas.Denormalization is also used to improve performance on smaller computers as in computerized cash-registers and mobile devices, since these may use the data for look-up only (e.g. price lookups). Denormalization may also be used when no RDBMS exists for a platform (such as Palm), or no changes are to be made to the data and a swift response is crucial.In recognition that denormalization can be deliberate and useful, the non-first normal form is a definition of database designs which do not conform to first normal form, by allowing \"sets and sets of sets to be attribute domains\" (Schek 1982). The languages used to query and manipulate data in the model must be extended accordingly to support such values.One way of looking at this is to consider such structured values as being specialized types of values (domains), with their own domain-specific languages. However, what is usually meant by non-1NF models is the approach in which the relational model and the languages used to query it are extended with a general mechanism for such structure; for instance, the nested relational model supports the use of relations as domain values, by adding two additional operators (\"nest\" and \"unnest\") to the relational algebra that can create and flatten nested relations, respectively.Although \"unnest\" is the mathematical inverse to \"nest\", the operator \"nest\" is not always the mathematical inverse of \"unnest\". Another constraint required is for the operators to be bijective, which is covered by the Partitioned Normal Form (PNF).<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Database normalization.Edgar F.

More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward flux of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point. For example, consider air as it is heated or cooled. The relevant vector field for this example is the velocity of the moving air at a point. If air is heated in a region it will expand in all directions such that the velocity field points outward from that region. Therefore the divergence of the velocity field in that region would have a positive value, as the region is a source. If the air cools and contracts, the divergence is negative and the region is called a sink.Definition of divergence.More rigorously, the divergence is defined as derivative of the net flow of the vector field across the surface of a small region relative to the volume of that region.where \"V\" is the volume of an arbitrary shaped region in R3 that includes the point p, \"S\"(\"V\") is the surface of that volume, and the integral is a surface integral with n being the outward normal to that surface. The result, div F, is a function of the location p. From this definition it also becomes explicitly visible that div F can be seen as the \"source density\" of the flux of F.The intuition that the sum of all sources minus the sum of all sinks should give the net flow outwards of a region is made precise by the divergence theorem.Application in Cartesian coordinates.Although expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under orthogonal transformations, as the physical interpretation suggests.Decomposition theorem.For the irrotational part one hasThis \"decomposition theorem\" is in fact a by-product of the stationary case of electrodynamics. It is a special case of the more general Helmholtz decomposition which works in dimensions greater than three as well.Properties.The following properties can all be derived from the ordinary differentiation rules of calculus. Most importantly, the divergence is a linear operator, i.e.for all vector fields F and G and all real numbers \"a\" and \"b\".There is a product rule of the following type: if formula_7 is a scalar valued function and F is a vector field, thenThe Laplacian of a scalar field is the divergence of the field's gradient.(where the first map is the gradient, the second is the curl, the third is the divergence) serves as a nice quantification of the complicatedness of the underlying region \"U\". These are the beginnings and main motivations of de Rham cohomology.Relation with the exterior derivative.One can establish a parallel between the divergence and a particular case of the exterior derivative, when it takes a 2-form to a 3-form in R3.its exterior derivative formula_18 is given byGeneralizations.The divergence of a vector field can be defined in any number of dimensions. Ifin a Euclidean coordinate system where formula_21 and formula_22, defineThe appropriate expression is more complicated in curvilinear coordinates.For any \"n\", the divergence is a linear operator, and it satisfies the \"product rule\"for any scalar-valued function formula_25.The divergence can be defined on any manifold of dimension \"n\" with a volume form (or density) formula_26 e.g. a Riemannian or Lorentzian manifold. Generalising the construction of a two form for a vectorfield on formula_27, on such a manifold a vectorfield \"X\" defines a \"n-1\" form formula_28 obtained by contracting \"X\" with formula_26. The divergence is then the function defined byStandard formulas for the Lie derivative allow us to reformulate this asThis means that the divergence measures the rate of expansion of a volume element as we let itOn a Riemannian or Lorentzian manifold the divergence with respect to the metric volume formcan be computed in terms of the Levi Civita connection formula_32where the second expression is the contraction of the vectorfield valued 1 -form formula_34 with itself and the last expression is the traditional coordinate expression used by physicists.Divergence can also be generalised to tensors.

Despite this, using alcohol to alleviate pain places people at risk for a number of harmful health consequences.\nWhat Are the Risks?\nMixing Alcohol and Pain Medicines Can Be Harmful\n\u00bb\u00bb\nMixing alcohol and acetaminophen can cause acute liver failure\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\nMixing alcohol and aspirin increases risk for gastric bleeding\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\nAlcohol increases analgesic, reinforcing, and sedative effects of opiates, elevating risk for combined misuse of alcohol and opiates as well as overdose.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re taking medications to manage your pain, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about any reactions that may result from mixing them with alcohol.\nAnalgesic Doses of Alcohol Exceed Moderate Drinking Guidelines\n\u00bb\u00bb\nThe greatest pain-reducing effects occur when alcohol is administered at doses exceeding guidelines for moderate daily alcohol use.*   \n\n\u00bb\u00bb\nTolerance develops to alcohol\u2019s analgesic effects so that it takes more alcohol to produce the same effects. Increasing alcohol use to stay ahead of tolerance can lead to other problems, including the development of alcohol dependence.\n\n\n*According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, drinking in moderation is defined as having no more than 1 drink per day for women and no more than 2 drinks per day for men.\nChronic Alcohol Drinking Makes Pain Worse\n\u00bb\u00bb\nWithdrawal from chronic alcohol use often increases pain sensitivity which could motivate some people to continue drinking or even increase their drinking to reverse withdrawal-related increases in pain.  \n\n\u00bb\u00bb\nProlonged, excessive alcohol exposure generates a painful small fiber peripheral neuropathy, the most common neurologic complication associated with alcoholism.\n\n\nIf you use alcohol to relieve your pain, it is important to learn about possible adverse health effects. Ask your health care provider if any alcohol use is safe for you.\n\nReferences:\nUSDA\/DHHS. Chapter 9: Alcoholic beverages. In: Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Women\u2019s bodies also react differently to alcohol than men\u2019s bodies. As a result, women face particular health risks and realities. \nWomen should be aware of the health risks associated with drinking alcohol, especially because most women drink at least occasionally, and many women drink a lot.  \nWhy Do Women Face Higher Risk?\nResearch shows that women start to have alcohol-related problems at lower drinking levels than men do. One reason is that, on average, women weigh less than men. In addition, alcohol resides predominantly in body water, and pound for pound, women have less water in their bodies than men do. So after a man and woman of the same weight drink the same amount of alcohol, the woman\u2019s blood alcohol concentration will tend to be higher, putting her at greater risk for harm. Other biological differences, including hormones, may contribute as well.\nWhat Are the Health Risks?\nLiver Damage: \nWomen who drink are more likely to develop alcoholic hepatitis (liver inflammation) than men who drink the same amount of alcohol. Alcoholic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis.\nHeart Disease:\nChronic heavy drinking is a leading cause of heart disease. Among heavy drinkers, women are more \n\nPhoto of three young women eating and laughing\nsusceptible to alcohol-related heart disease than men, even though women drink less alcohol over a lifetime than men. \nBreast Cancer:\nThere is an association between drinking alcohol and developing breast cancer. Women who consume about one drink per day have a 10 percent higher chance of developing breast cancer than women who do not drink at all. That risk rises another 10 percent for every extra drink they have per day.\nPregnancy:\nAny drinking during pregnancy is risky. A pregnant woman who drinks heavily puts her fetus at risk for learning and behavioral problems and abnormal facial features. Even moderate drinking during pregnancy can cause problems. Drinking during pregnancy also may increase the risk for preterm labor.\nSome women should never drink at all, including:\n\u00bb\u00bb\nAnyone under age 21\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\nAnyone who takes medications that can interact negatively with alcohol\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\nAnyone who is pregnant or trying to conceive\n\n\nFor more information, please visit: http:\/\/www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov\/\n\nHow Much Is Too Much?\nIn the United States, a standard drink is one that contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is found in:\n\u00bb\u00bb\n12 ounces of beer with 5 percent alcohol content\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\n5 ounces of wine with 12 percent alcohol content\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\n1.5 ounces of distilled spirits with 40 percent alcohol content\n\n\nThe USDA defines moderate drinking as:\n\u00bb\u00bb\nUp to 1 drink per day for women\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\nUp to 2 drinks per day for men\n\n\nUnfortunately, although the \u201cstandard\u201d drink amounts are helpful for following health guidelines, they may not reflect customary serving sizes. A large cup of beer, an overpoured glass of wine, or a single mixed drink could contain much more alcohol than a standard drink. In addition, while the alcohol concentrations listed are \u201ctypical,\u201d there is considerable variability in alcohol content within each type of beverage (e.g., beer, wine, distilled spirits).\n\n\nNIH . . .

Even within these limits, you can have problems if you drink too quickly or have other health issues. Drinking slowly, and making sure you eat enough while drinking, can help minimize alcohol\u2019s effects.<\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q482","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Department of Health and Human Services logo National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism W...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID482"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID433","SecondaryAttribute":"DHHS, NIH, and NCI logos How can we help?

Five years later, having grown by 33 centimetres, he made his Serie A debut with Udinese, though Zoff made only four appearances for Udinese before moving to Mantova in 1963.In 1968, Zoff was transferred to Napoli. In the same year he made his debut for Italy, playing against Bulgaria in the quarter final of the 1968 European Championships. Italy proceeded to win the tournament, Zoff taking home a winners' medal after only his fourth international appearance.Coaching career.After his retirement as a player, Zoff went into coaching, joining the technical staff at Juventus, where he was head coach from 1988 to 1990. In 1990 he was sacked, despite winning the UEFA Cup. He then joined Lazio, where he became president in 1994.In 1998 Zoff was appointed coach of the Italian national team.

Such applications are known as \"CGI scripts\"; they can be written in any programming language, although scripting languages are often used.Purpose.The task of a webserver is to respond to requests for webpages issued by clients (usually web browsers) by analyzing the content of the request (which is mostly in its URL), determining an appropriate document to send in response, and returning it to the client.If the request identifies a file on disk, the server can just return the file's contents. Alternatively, the document's content can be composed on the fly. One way of doing this is to let a console application compute the document's contents, and tell the web server to use that console application. CGI specifies which information is communicated between the webserver and such a console application, and how.The webserver software will invoke the console application as a command. CGI defines how information about the request (such as the URL) is passed to the command in the form of arguments and environment variables. The application is supposed to write the output document to standard output; CGI defines how it can pass back extra information about the output (such as the MIME type, which defines the type of document being returned) by prepending it with headers.History.The NCSA team wrote the specification, and NCSA still hosts it at its original location. The other webserver developers adopted it, and it has been a standard for webservers ever since.Example.An example of a CGI program is one implementing a wiki. The user agent requests the name of an entry; the server will retrieve the source of that entry's page (if one exists), transform it into HTML, and send the result.More details.From the Web server's point of view, certain locators, e.g. http:\/\/www.example.com\/wiki.cgi, are defined as corresponding to a program to execute via CGI. When a request for the URL is received, the corresponding program is executed.Data is passed into the program using environment variables. This is in contrast to typical execution, where Command-line arguments are used. In the case of HTTP PUT or POSTs, the user-submitted data is provided to the program via the standard input.Web servers often have a cgi-bin\/ directory at the base of their directory tree to hold executable files called with CGI.The program returns the result to the web server in the form of standard output, prefixed by a header and a blank line.Header format.The header is encoded in the same way as an HTTP header and must include the MIME type of the document returned. The headers are generally forwarded with the response back to the user, supplemented by the web server.Drawbacks.Calling a command generally means the invocation of a newly created process. Starting up the process can take up much more time and memory than the actual work of generating the output, especially when the program still needs to be interpreted or compiled.If the command is called often, the resulting workload can quickly overwhelm the web server.The overhead involved in interpretation may be reduced by using compiled CGI programs, such as those in C\/C++, rather than using Perl or other scripting languages. The overhead involved in process creation can be reduced by solutions such as FastCGI, or by running the application code entirely within the webserver using special extension modules.Alternatives.The optimal configuration for any web application depends on application-specific details, amount of traffic, and complexity of the transaction; these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q74","QuestionID":"QID74"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID188","SecondaryAttribute":"Dino Zoff.Dino Zoff (born February 28, 1942 in Mariano del Friuli) is an Italian former football...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Dino Zoff.Dino Zoff (born February 28, 1942 in Mariano del Friuli) is an Italian former football goalkeeper and is the oldest winner ever of the World Cup, which he earned as captain of the Italian team in the 1982 tournament in Spain, at the age of 40.After retiring as a footballer, Zoff went on to become coach for the Italian national team and several other Italian clubs.Playing career.Dino Zoff was born in Mariano del Friuli, Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy), and was elected in a poll by the IFFHS as the third best goalkeeper of the 20th Century - after Lev Yashin (1st) and Gordon Banks (2nd).Zoff's career got off to an inauspicious start, when at the age of fourteen he had trials with Inter Milan and Juventus F.C., but was rejected due to a lack of height. Five years later, having grown by 33 centimetres, he made his Serie A debut with Udinese, though Zoff made only four appearances for Udinese before moving to Mantova in 1963.In 1968, Zoff was transferred to Napoli. In the same year he made his debut for Italy, playing against Bulgaria in the quarter final of the 1968 European Championships. Italy proceeded to win the tournament, Zoff taking home a winners' medal after only his fourth international appearance.Coaching career.After his retirement as a player, Zoff went into coaching, joining the technical staff at Juventus, where he was head coach from 1988 to 1990. In 1990 he was sacked, despite winning the UEFA Cup. He then joined Lazio, where he became president in 1994.In 1998 Zoff was appointed coach of the Italian national team.

More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward flux of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point. For example, consider air as it is heated or cooled. The relevant vector field for this example is the velocity of the moving air at a point. If air is heated in a region it will expand in all directions such that the velocity field points outward from that region. Therefore the divergence of the velocity field in that region would have a positive value, as the region is a source. If the air cools and contracts, the divergence is negative and the region is called a sink.Definition of divergence.More rigorously, the divergence is defined as derivative of the net flow of the vector field across the surface of a small region relative to the volume of that region.where \"V\" is the volume of an arbitrary shaped region in R3 that includes the point p, \"S\"(\"V\") is the surface of that volume, and the integral is a surface integral with n being the outward normal to that surface. The result, div F, is a function of the location p. From this definition it also becomes explicitly visible that div F can be seen as the \"source density\" of the flux of F.The intuition that the sum of all sources minus the sum of all sinks should give the net flow outwards of a region is made precise by the divergence theorem.Application in Cartesian coordinates.Although expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under orthogonal transformations, as the physical interpretation suggests.Decomposition theorem.For the irrotational part one hasThis \"decomposition theorem\" is in fact a by-product of the stationary case of electrodynamics. It is a special case of the more general Helmholtz decomposition which works in dimensions greater than three as well.Properties.The following properties can all be derived from the ordinary differentiation rules of calculus. Most importantly, the divergence is a linear operator, i.e.for all vector fields F and G and all real numbers \"a\" and \"b\".There is a product rule of the following type: if formula_7 is a scalar valued function and F is a vector field, thenThe Laplacian of a scalar field is the divergence of the field's gradient.(where the first map is the gradient, the second is the curl, the third is the divergence) serves as a nice quantification of the complicatedness of the underlying region \"U\". These are the beginnings and main motivations of de Rham cohomology.Relation with the exterior derivative.One can establish a parallel between the divergence and a particular case of the exterior derivative, when it takes a 2-form to a 3-form in R3.its exterior derivative formula_18 is given byGeneralizations.The divergence of a vector field can be defined in any number of dimensions. Ifin a Euclidean coordinate system where formula_21 and formula_22, defineThe appropriate expression is more complicated in curvilinear coordinates.For any \"n\", the divergence is a linear operator, and it satisfies the \"product rule\"for any scalar-valued function formula_25.The divergence can be defined on any manifold of dimension \"n\" with a volume form (or density) formula_26 e.g. a Riemannian or Lorentzian manifold. Generalising the construction of a two form for a vectorfield on formula_27, on such a manifold a vectorfield \"X\" defines a \"n-1\" form formula_28 obtained by contracting \"X\" with formula_26. The divergence is then the function defined byStandard formulas for the Lie derivative allow us to reformulate this asThis means that the divergence measures the rate of expansion of a volume element as we let itOn a Riemannian or Lorentzian manifold the divergence with respect to the metric volume formcan be computed in terms of the Levi Civita connection formula_32where the second expression is the contraction of the vectorfield valued 1 -form formula_34 with itself and the last expression is the traditional coordinate expression used by physicists.Divergence can also be generalised to tensors.

Critical psychology is aimed at critiquing mainstream psychology and which attempts to apply psychology in more progressive ways, often looking towards social change as a means of preventing and treating psychopathology.One of Critical Psychology's main criticisms of conventional psychology is how it fails to consider or deliberately ignores the way power differences between social classes and groups can impact the mental and physical well-being of individuals or groups of people.Origins.Klaus Holzkamp.One of the most important and sophisticated books in the field is the \"Grundlegung der Psychologie\" (\"Foundations of Psychology\") by Klaus Holzkamp, who might be considered the theoretical founder of critical psychology. Holzkamp, who had written 2 books on theory of science and one on sensory perception before publishing the \"Grundlegung der Psychologie\" in 1983, thought this major work provided a solid paradigm for psychological research, as he viewed psychology as a pre-paradigmatic scientific discipline (T.S. Kuhn had used the term \"pre-paradigmatic\" for social science).One core result of Holzkamp's historical and comparative analysis of human reproductive action, perception and cognition is a very specific concept of meaning that identifies symbolical meaning as historically and culturally constructed, purposeful conceptual structures that humans create in close relationship to material culture and within the context of historically specific formations of social reproduction.Coming from this phenomenological perspective on culturally mediated and socially situated action, Holzkamp launched a devastating and original methodological attack on behaviorism (which he termed S-R (stimulus-response) psychology) based on linguistic analysis, showing in minute detail the rhetorical patterns by which this approach to psychology creates the illusion of \"scientific objectivity\" while at the same time losing relevance for understanding culturally situated, intentional human actions. Against this approach, he developed his own approach to generalization and objectivity, drawing on ideas from Kurt Lewin in Chapter 9 of \"Grundlegung der Psychologie\".His last major publication before his death in 1995 was about learning. It appeared in 1993 and contained a phenomenological theory of learning from the standpoint of the subject. One important concept Holzkamp developed was \"reinterpretation\" of theories developed by conventional psychology. This meant to look at these concepts from the standpoint of the paradigm of critical psychology, thereby integrating their useful insights into critical psychology while at the same time identifying and criticizing their limiting implications while (which in the case of S-R-psychology were the rhetorical elimination of the subject and intentional action, and in the case of cognitive psychology which did take into account subjective motives and intentional actions, methodological individualism). The first part of the book thus contains an extensive look at the history of psychological theories of learning and a minute re-interpretation of those concepts from the perspective of the paradigm of critical psychology, which focuses on intentional action situated in specific socio-historical\/cultural contexts. The conceptions of learning he found most useful in his own detailed analysis of \"classroom learning\" came from cognitive anthropologists Jean Lave (situated learning) and Edwin Hutchins (distributed cognition). The book's second part contained an extensive analysis on the modern state's institutionalized forms of \"classroom learning\" as the cultural-historical context that shapes much of modern learning and socialization. In this analysis, he heavily drew upon Michel Foucault's \"Discipline and Punish\". Holzkamp felt that classroom learning as the historically specific form of learning does not make full use of student's potentials, but rather limits her or his learning potentials by a number of \"teaching strategies.\" Part of his motivation for the book was to look for alternative forms of learning that made use of the enormous potential of the human psyche in more fruitful ways. Consequently, in the last section of the book, Holzkamp discusses forms of \"expansive learning\" that seem to avoid the limitations of classroom learning, such as apprenticeship and learning in contexts other than classrooms.This search culminated in plans to write a major work on life leadership in the specific historical context of modern (capitalist) society. Due to his death in 1995, this work never got past the stage of early (and premature) conceptualizations, some of which were published in the journals \"Forum Kritische Psychologie\" and \"Argument\".1960 through 1970.In the 1960s and 1970s the term \"radical psychology\" was used by psychologists to denote a branch of the field which rejected conventional psychology's focus on the individual as the basic unit of analysis and sole source of psychopathology. Instead, radical psychologists examined the role of society in causing and treating problems and looked towards social change as an alternative to therapy to treat mental illness and as a means of preventing psychopathology. Within psychiatry the term \"anti-psychiatry\" was often used and now British activists prefer the term \"critical psychiatry\". \"Critical Psychology\" is currently the preferred term for the discipline of psychology keen to find alternatives to the way the discipline of psychology reduces human experience to the level of the individual and thereby strips away possibilities for radical social change.In the 1990s.Starting in the 1990s a new wave of books started to appear on critical psychology, the most influential being the edited book \"Critical Psychology\" by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky. Various introductory texts to critical psychology written in the United Kingdom have tended to focus on discourse, but this has been seen by some proponents of critical psychology as a reduction of human experience to language which is as politically dangerous as the way mainstream psychology reduces experience to the individual mind.Critical Psychology today.There are a few international journals devoted to critical psychology, including the International Journal of Critical Psychology (no longer published) and the Annual Review of Critical Psychology. The journals still tend to be directed to an academic audience, though the Annual Review of Critical Psychology runs as an open-access online journal. There are close links between critical psychologists and critical psychiatrists in Britain through the. Critical psychology courses and research concentrations are available at, the, the and the and the University of AucklandCriticisms of conventional psychology.One of the criticisms of conventional psychology raised by critical psychology is the inattention to power differentials between different groups - examples include between psychiatrists and patients, psychologists and clients, wealthy groups and the less financially well-off, or industrial lobbyists and the general public. This inattention to power has resulted in conventional psychology tending to assume that how things are is how they should be, that the current state of affairs is the natural state of things. As a result, conventional psychology has a tendency to uphold the status quo, blame the victim, and situate problems within individuals rather than the social context they are embedded in.Extensions.Like many critical applications, critical psychology has expanded beyond Marxist roots to benefit from other critical approaches. Consider ecopsychology and transpersonal psychology. Critical psychology and related work has also sometimes been labelled radical psychology and liberation psychology. In the field of developmental psychology, the work of Erica Burman has been influential.Various sub-disciplines within psychology have begun to establish their own critical orientations. Perhaps the most extensive are Critical Health Psychology and Community Psychology.Germany.At FU-Berlin, critical psychology was not really seen as a division of psychology and followed its own methodology, trying to reformulate traditional psychology on an unorthodox Marxist base and drawing from Soviet ideas of cultural-historical psychology, particularly Aleksey Leontyev. Some years ago the department of critical psychology at the FU-Berlin was merged into the traditional psychology department.An (edited by Desmond Painter, Athanasios Marvakis, and Leendert Mos) is devoted to an examination of German Critical Psychology.South Africa.The University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa, is one of few worldwide to offer a. For an overview of critical psychology in South Africa, see Desmond Painter and Martin Terre Blanche's article on. They have also now started a.United States and Canada.Critical psychology in the United States and Canada has, for the most part, focused on critiques of mainstream psychology's support for an unjust \"status quo\". No departments of critical psychology exist, though critical perspectives are sometimes encountered in traditional universities, perhaps especially within. North American efforts include the 1993 founding of RadPsyNet, the 1997 publication of (edited by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky), and the action-focused (Psychologists Acting with Conscience Together).<\/div><div><br><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q126","QuestionID":"QID126"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID112","SecondaryAttribute":"During what time of day did the young bear find blueberries?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"During what time of day did the young bear find blueberries?","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"During what time of day did the young bear find blueberries?","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Dawn"},"2":{"Display":"Morning"},"3":{"Display":"Afternoon"},"4":{"Display":"Dusk"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3,4],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"QuestionText_Unsafe":"What food did the narrator and his family not eat for breakfast?","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"DataExportTag":"Q112","QuestionID":"QID112"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID85","SecondaryAttribute":"During which activities does the hamster sit on the narrator's shoulder?

Pretty soon, most explanations end up using a bevy of complicated words and terms that may as well be another language. It doesnt have to be this way, however, because the benefits of using encrypted email are simple, and the core concepts of email encryption can be easy to understand as well. Today, we decided to break down email encryption to its basics so you can learn what email encryption is and why its important for your business, without all the technical mumbo jumbo.<\/div><div>&nbsp;1. What is Email Encryption?<\/div><div>&nbsp;Email encryption is a way to protect your emails from being read by other people or computers. Essentially, what it does is scrambles an email heading out from your computer and reassembles it for the intended person. And when you receive an email, it scrambles it and puts it back together again before you read it, reducing the chances of any of the information getting into the wrong hands. By using encrypted email, the only people who will see an email is the sender and its intended recipients.<\/div><div>&nbsp;2. Why Do People &amp; Companies Use Encrypted Email<\/div><div>&nbsp;Like most technological services, email encryption is used for a number of reasons. The overarching reasons, however, boil down to security and privacy. In general, companies use email encryption to meet security protocols. Since sensitive information is often sent through email, it is important for businesses to keep that information as protected as possible.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Privacy is the other major reason, and this is often why individuals will use email encryption for their own private email accounts. Since the online experience increasingly uses software to track the movements of people online, emails are becoming easier and easier to break into or spy on. With email encryption, those emails can travel more safely and can better maintain their privacy.<\/div><div>&nbsp;3. Do I Need Email Encryption?<\/div><div>&nbsp;Generally, email encryption is recommended for two reasons: because your email always has sensitive information, and because you should be compliant with security protocols.<\/div><div>&nbsp;First off, your email account has private information. Everything from emails about resetting passwords to notices from you bank include information that could compromise your confidentiality. So even when you think your email is mostly for confirming appointments and seeing whos having a sale this week, they are actually loaded with stuff you want to keep to yourself.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Secondly, if you run a business that has clients, you should be taking steps to ensure any information sent between your two parties is confidential. This includes using encrypted email to help keep things secure.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Encrypted email is absolutely essential in the modern business world, but that doesnt mean it needs to be complicated. The technology itself may be quite fascinating, but the benefits are immediate: with encrypted email, you will be safer, your companys information will be safer, and you will enjoy a level of privacy previously unavailable through unencrypted email.

Since EC methods act before implantation, they are medically and legally considered forms of contraception. Some scientists believe that EC may possibly act after fertilization (see Mechanism of action), a possibility that leads some to consider EC an abortifacient.Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs).Emergency contraceptive pills (sometimes referred to as emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) in the U.K.) may contain higher doses of the same hormones (estrogens, progestins, or both) found in regular combined oral contraceptive pills. Taken after unprotected sexual intercourse, such higher doses may prevent pregnancy from occurring. Mifepristone can be used as EC, but is an anti-hormonal drug, and does not contain estrogen or progestins.The phrase \"morning-after pill\" is a misnomer; ECPs are effective when used shortly before intercourse, and are licensed for use up to 72 hours after sexual intercourse and the WHO says they can be used for up to 5 days after contraceptive failure (see \"Effectiveness\" section below).Types of ECPs.The combined or Yuzpe regimen uses large doses of both estrogen and progestin, taken as two doses at a 12-hour interval. This method is now believed to be less effective and less well-tolerated than the progestin-only method.It is possible to obtain the same dosage of hormones, and therefore the same effect, by taking several regular combined oral contraceptive pills. For example, 4 Ovral pills are the same as 4 Preven pills. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this off-label use of certain brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills in 1997.Ulipristal acetate (Ellaone), a drug similar to mifepristone, was approved as an ECP in early 2009.Effectiveness of ECPs.The effectiveness of emergency contraception is presented differently from the effectiveness of ongoing methods of birth control: it is expressed as a percentage reduction in pregnancy rate for a single use of EC. Different ECP regimens have different effectiveness levels, and even for a single regimen different studies may find varying rates of effectiveness. Using an example of \"75% effective\", an article in \"American Family Physician\" explains the effectiveness calculation thus:... these numbers do not translate into a pregnancy rate of 25 percent. Rather, they mean that if 1,000 women have unprotected intercourse in the middle two weeks of their menstrual cycles, approximately 80 will become pregnant. Use of emergency contraceptive pills would reduce this number by 75 percent, to 20 women.The progestin-only regimen (using levonorgestrel) is reported by the U.S. FDA to have an 89% effectiveness., the labeling on the U.S. brand Plan B explained this effectiveness rate by stating, \"Seven out of every eight women who would have gotten pregnant will not become pregnant.\"In 1999, a meta-analysis of eight studies of the combined (Yuzpe) regimen concluded that the best point estimate of effectiveness was 74%. A 2003 analysis of two of the largest combined (Yuzpe) regimen studies, using a different calculation method, found effectiveness estimates of 47% and 53%.For both the progestin-only and Yuzpe regimens, the effectiveness of emergency contraception is highest when taken within 12 hours of intercourse and declines over time.While most studies of emergency contraception have only enrolled women within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, a 2002 study by the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that reasonable effectiveness may continue for up to 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse.History of calculation methods.Early studies of emergency contraceptives did not attempt to calculate a failure rate; they simply reported the number of women who became pregnant after using an emergency contraceptive. Since 1980, clinical trials of emergency contraception have first calculated probable pregnancies in the study group if no treatment were given. The effectiveness is calculated by dividing observed pregnancies by the estimated number of pregnancies without treatment.Placebo-controlled trials that could give a precise measure of the pregnancy rate without treatment would be unethical, so the effectiveness percentage is based on estimated pregnancy rates. These are currently estimated using variants of the calendar method.Calculation of effectiveness, and particularly the denominator of the fraction, involves many assumptions that are difficult to validate. Therefore, reported figures on the efficacy of emergency contraception may be underestimates or, more probably, overestimates. Yet, precise estimates of efficacy may not be highly relevant to many women who have had unprotected intercourse, since ECPs are often the only available treatment.Recently, hormonal assay has been suggested as a more accurate method of estimating fertility for EC studies.Safety.Existing pregnancy is not a contraindication in terms of safety, as there is no known harm to the woman, the course of her pregnancy, or the fetus if progestin-only or combined emergency contraception pills are accidentally used, but EC is not indicated for a woman with a known or suspected pregnancy because it is not effective in women who are already pregnant.The World Health Organization (WHO) lists no medical condition for which the risks of emergency contraceptive pills outweigh the benefits. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and experts on emergency contraception have concluded that progestin-only ECPs may be preferable to combined ECPs containing estrogen in women with a history of blood clots, stroke, or migraine.The AAP, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, WHO, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and other experts on emergency contraception state that there are no medical conditions in which progestin-only ECPs are contraindicated. RCOG specifically note current venous thromboembolism, current or past history of breast cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and acute intermittent porphyria as conditions where the advantages of using emergency contraceptive pills generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.The herbal preparation of St John's wort and some enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants or rifampicin) may reduce the effectiveness of ECP, and a larger dose may be required.The AAP, ACOG, FDA, WHO, RCOG, and experts on emergency contraception have concluded that ECPs, like all other contraceptives, reduce the absolute risk of ectopic pregnancy by preventing pregnancies, and that the best available evidence, obtained from over 7,800 women in randomized controlled trials, indicates there is no increase in the relative risk of ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant after using progestin-only ECPs.Side effects.The most common side effect reported by users of emergency contraceptive pills was nausea (50.5% of 979 Yuzpe regimen users and 23.1% of 977 levonorgestrel-only users in the 1998 WHO trial; 14.3% of 2,720 levonorgestrel-only users in the 2002 WHO trial); vomiting is much less common and unusual with levonorgestrel-only ECPs (18.8% of 979 Yuzpe regimen users and 5.6% of levonorgestrel-only users in the 1998 WHO trial; 1.4% of 2,720 levonorgestrel-only users in the 2002 WHO trial).Anti-emetics are not routinely recommended with levonorgestrel-only ECPs.If a woman vomits within 2 hours of taking a levonorgestrel-only ECP, she should take a further dose as soon as possible.Other common side effects (each reported by less than 20% of levonorgestrel-only users in both the 1998 and 2002 WHO trials) were abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and breast tenderness.Side effects usually do not occur for more than a few days after treatment, and they generally resolve within 24 hours.Intrauterine device (IUD) for emergency contraception.Postcoital high-dose progestin-only oral contraceptive pills as ongoing contraception.History.The use of synthetic estrogens as a post coital contraceptive was discovered by Dr. John McLean Morris in 1966. A few different drugs were studied, with a focus on high-dose estrogens, and it was originally hoped that postcoital contraception would prove viable as an ongoing contraceptive method.The first widely used methods were five-day treatments with high-dose estrogens, using diethylstilbestrol (DES) in the US and ethinyl estradiol in the Netherlands.In the early 1970s, the Yuzpe regimen was developed by AA Yuzpe (1974); progestin-only postcoital contraception was investigated (1975); and the copper IUD was first studied for use as emergency contraception (1975). Danazol was tested in the early 1980s in the hopes that it would have fewer side effects than Yuzpe, but was found to be ineffective.The Yuzpe regimen became the standard course of treatment for postcoital contraception in many countries in the 1980s. The first prescription-only combined estrogen-progestin dedicated product, Schering PC4 (ethinylestradiol and norgestrel), was approved in the UK in January 1984 and first marketed in October 1984. Schering introduced a second prescription-only combined product, Tetragynon (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) in Germany in 1985. By 1997, Schering AG dedicated prescription-only combined products had been approved in only 9 countries: the UK (Schering PC4), New Zealand (Schering PC4), South Africa (E-Gen-C), Germany (Tetragynon), Switzerland (Tetragynon), Denmark (Tetragynon), Norway (Tetragynon), Sweden (Tetragynon) and Finland (Neoprimavlar); and had been withdrawn from marketing in New Zealand in 1997 to prevent it being sold over-the-counter. Regular combined oral contraceptive pills (which were less expensive and more widely available) were more commonly used for the Yuzpe regimen even in countries where dedicated products were available.Over time, interest in progestin-only treatments increased. The Special Program on Human Reproduction (HRP), an international organization whose members include the World Bank and World Health Organization, \"played a pioneering role in emergency contraception\" by \"confirming the effectiveness of levonorgestrel.\" After the WHO conducted a large trial comparing Yuzpe and levonorgestrel in 1998, combined estrogen-progestin products were gradually withdrawn from some markets (\"Preven\" in the United States discontinued May 2004, \"Schering PC4\" in the UK discontinued October 2001, and \"Tetragynon\" in France) in favor of progestin-only EC, although prescription-only dedicated Yuzpe regimen products are still available in some countries.In 2002, China became the first country in which mifepristone was registered for use as EC.International Consortium for Emergency Contraception.In 1995, the Rockefeller Foundation convened a meeting to discuss emergency contraception. After the meeting, a group of seven international organizations formed The International Consortium for Emergency Contraception (ICEC) to promote EC as a part of mainstream reproductive health care worldwide. Dedicated products for EC were \"virtually unknown\" in 1995, there was little awareness of EC as an option, and EC was not used as public health measure.The seven founding member organizations were the Concept Foundation, the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), the Pacific Institute for Women's Health, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Population Council, Population Services International, and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH).The Concept Foundation is the distribution arm of ICEC; its funding for the development of Postinor-2 came from the Rockefeller Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, as well as the other ICEC organizations.An ICEC member organization, the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), has launched its own dedicated levonorgestrel EC product, Optinor.Conscience Clause.Relationship to high risk sex and abortion.The current (October 2005) \"AAP Policy Statement on Emergency Contraception\" states: \"The concern that widespread emergency contraception use would encourage unprotected coitus in teens is not supported in the literature.\"The current (December 2005) \"ACOG Practice Bulletin on Emergency Contraception\" states: \"A prominent concern among both women and health care providers is that making emergency contraception more readily available could encourage irresponsible sexual behavior, which would increase the risks of both unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. However, numerous studies have shown that this concern is unfounded.\"The latest (April 2007) review by emergency contraception experts Trussell and Raymond states: \"Reported evidence demonstrates that making ECPs more widely available does not increase risk-takingand that women who are the most diligent about ongoing contraceptive use are those most likely to seek emergency treatment.\"EC and sexual assault.Before EC was used in the general population or defined as \"emergency contraception,\" it was used, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, specifically as a treatment for victims of sexual assault. Pregnancy rates among rape victims of child-bearing age are around 5%; in the U.S., about half of rape victims who become pregnant have abortions. Although EC is commonly used as an option for victims of sexual assault, some researchers believe such use is a public health measure that is not sufficiently widespread.Mechanism of action.The United States FDA states that progestin-only ECPs like Plan B work by preventing ovulation. It also says \"it is possible\" that progestin-only ECPs may interfere with the blastocyst implanting in the uterine lining, and that they have no effect on pregnancies if taken after implantation.A number of studies in the 1970s and 80s concluded that emergency contraception could cause changes in the endometrium that would prevent implantation of an early-stage embryo in the uterus. This research led many pro-life advocates, who believe that pregnancy begins at fertilization, to oppose ECPs as an abortifacient.However, these studies have also shown that, in women who ovulate despite taking ECP before ovulation, there are changes in certain hormones such as progesterone and in the length of luteal phase. These secondary changes might inhibit implantation in cases where fertilization occurs despite ECP use. Because of the difficulty of studying zygotes inside the uterus and fallopian tubes prior to implantation, both sides of this debate concede that completely proving or disproving the theory may be impossible.When used as a regular method of contraception, IUDs have been proven to act primarily through spermicidal and ovicidal mechanisms, but it is considered possible that these same mechanisms are also harmful to zygotes that have not yet implanted.Hormonal progestin-only and combined estrogen-progestin emergency contraceptives such as Yuzpe regimen or Plan B differ from the anti-hormonal drug mifepristone (also known as Mifeprex and RU-486). Yuzpe and progestin-only emergency contraception will have no effect if taken after implantation, whereas mifepristone can induce abortion if taken after implantation.United States legal and ethical controversies.A great deal of controversy accompanied the FDA approval of over-the-counter (OTC) access to Plan B. Supporters of over-the-counter access believe that easier access will reduce unintended pregnancy and abortion rates; some abortion opponents believe that EC itself is a form of abortion. The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and other leading U.S. medical organizations all supported OTC access. An advisory committee to the FDA recommended that Plan B be made available over the counter in 2003. In 2004, the FDA refused the advisory board's recommendation and prohibited over-the-counter sale, citing insufficient evidence that ECPs could be used safely by adolescents without medical supervision. Reproductive rights supporters accused the FDA of basing the decision on political pressure from the pro-life lobby. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit regarding the approval process, which had not been resolved. In the legal proceedings, two senior FDA officials alleged in depositions that the decision to reject the OTC application was made on political, rather than scientific, grounds to \"appease the administration's constituents\". Depositions taken from other FDA officials do not indicate White House involvement. In 2006, the FDA approved over-the-counter access to Plan B for women 18 years of age and older. In April 2009, the FDA followed the ruling of a New York Federal District Court and loosened the restrictions to allow Duramed Pharmaceuticals to provide Plan B without a prescription to 17-year-olds. However, as of June 2009, Duramed had not yet put a non-prescription Plan B product for 17-year-olds through FDA approval, a process that could take some time.A Massachusetts law that went into effect on 14 December 2005, requires all hospitals in the state to provide emergency contraception to any \"female rape victim of childbearing age\" including Catholic Hospitals who oppose the provision of emergency contraception. In a letter criticizing the joint UN\/WHO \"Inter-agency Field Manual on Reproductive Health in Refugee Situations\", the Catholic Church explains its belief that emergency contraception, along with IUDs and hormonal contraception, cannot be considered \"solely contraceptive because in the case of effective fertilization a chemical abortion would be carried out during the first days of pregnancy.\" The Catholic position on family planning is explained further in \"Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services.\" Because of this expressed moral stance against emergency contraception, the Massachusetts Catholic Conference opposed this law, stating interference with religious freedom. According to \"The New England Journal of Medicine\", \"compelling arguments can be made both for and against a pharmacist's right to refuse prescriptions for emergency contraception.\"In isolated instances across the United States, pharmacists have refused to dispense emergency contraception even when presented with a legal prescription. In addition, Wal-Mart, the nation's fifth-largest distributor of pharmaceuticals, refused to stock EC, beginning with Preven in 1999. However, Wal-Mart reversed this position when it was announced that stores would sell Plan B in March 2006.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q256","QuestionID":"QID256","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Emergency contraception.Emergency contraception (EC), or emergency postcoital contraception, refe...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[]}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID565","SecondaryAttribute":"Encrypting your email isnt as difficult as you might think. \u00a0Email is the simplest and most famil..","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<p>Encrypting your email isnt as difficult as you might think.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Email is the simplest and most familiar way to send a message or a document.

It is done to protect potentially sensitive information from landing in any hand other than the intended recipients. Authentication is required to read an encrypted email.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Encrypted emails are not just for those who are likely to email sensitive information such as login credentials, social security numbers, and bank account numbers. People with malicious intent such as hackers can gain access to email accounts and download important attachments and files which might compromise the owner of the email in a big way. It's not out of the realm of possibility for someone to hijack the whole email account and use it as if it was theirs.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Email has always been a vulnerable channel of communication, especially when sent over unsecured wi-fi or public networks. Even those sent within secure company networks can still be intercepted by other users. Through encryption, the contents of the emails will be unreadable as they are transmitted from the origin to the destination and if someone were to try to intercept the emails, they will not be able to interpret the contents therein.<\/p><p>&nbsp;How does encrypted email look on the receiving end?<\/p><p>&nbsp;How an encrypted email looks like and how it is accessed may vary from one encryption service to another. However, more than likely, you will receive a notification telling you that you have received an encrypted email along with an access link.<\/p><p>&nbsp;When you click the link to read the encrypted email, an account verification screen will appear, and if you do not have an account with the email encryption company or the tool used to decrypt the message, you will be required to create one, after which you will log in and access the contents of the email. Once you access the message, you will be able to read it as normal.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Further Reading:<\/p><p>&nbsp;ShareFile Blog: How to install the Plugin for Microsoft Outlook and Encrypted Email on any PC<\/p><p>&nbsp;ShareFile Knowledge Base: How to use ShareFile Encrypted Email&nbsp;<\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q565","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Encrypting your email isnt as difficult as you might think. \u00a0Email is the simplest and most famil...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID565","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID486","SecondaryAttribute":"ENGLISH Choose More than 50 Ways to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes Learn how to prevent or delay type 2...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<p>ENGLISH\nChoose More than 50 Ways  to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes\nLearn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing a small amount of weight.

It was not until 1826 that the energetic Dost Mohammad Khan was able to exert sufficient control over his brothers to take over the throne in Kabul, where he proclaimed himself the Shah.Dost Mohammad achieved prominence among his brothers through clever use of the support of his mother's Qizilbash tribesmen and his own youthful apprenticeship under his brother, Fateh Khan. Among the many problems he faced was repelling Sikh encroachment on the Pashtun areas east of the Khyber Pass. After working assiduously to establish control and stability in his domains around Kabul, the Shah next chose to confront the Sikhs.In 1834 Dost Mohammad defeated an invasion by the former ruler, Shuja Shah Durrani, but his absence from Kabul gave the Sikhs the opportunity to expand westward. Ranjit Singh's forces occupied Peshawar, moving from there into territory ruled directly by Kabul. In 1836 Dost Mohammad's forces, under the command of his son Mohammad Akbar Khan, defeated the Sikhs at Jamrud, a post fifteen kilometres west of Peshawar. This was a pyrrhic victory and they failed to fully dislodge the Sikhs from Jamrud. The Afghan leader did not follow up this triumph by retaking Peshawar, however, but instead contacted Lord Auckland, the new British governor general in British India, for help in dealing with the Sikhs. With this letter, Dost Mohammad formally set the stage for British intervention in Afghanistan. At the heart of the Great Game lay the willingness of Britain and Russia to subdue, subvert, or subjugate the small independent states that lay between Russia and British India.The Great Game.The British became the major power in the Indian sub-continent after the Treaty of Paris (1763) and began to show interest in Afghanistan as early as their 1809 treaty with Shuja Shah Durrani. It was the threat of the expanding Russian Empire beginning to push for an advantage in the Afghanistan region that placed pressure on British India, in what became known as the \"Great Game\". The Great Game set in motion the confrontation of the British and Russian empires, whose spheres of influence moved steadily closer to one another until they met in Afghanistan. It also involved Britain's repeated attempts to impose a puppet government in Kabul. The remainder of the nineteenth century saw greater European involvement in Afghanistan and her surrounding territories and heightened conflict among the ambitious local rulers as Afghanistan's fate played out globally.At the same time, the Russians feared permanent British occupation in Central Asia as the British encroached northward, taking the Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir; later to become Pakistan. The British viewed Russia's absorption of the Caucasus, the Kyrgyz and Turkmen lands, the Khanate of Khiva, and the Emirate of Bukhara with equal suspicion as a threat to their interests in the Asian subcontinent.In addition to this rivalry between Britain and Russia, there were two specific reasons for British concern over Russia's intentions. First was the Russian influence at the Iranian court, which prompted the Russians to support Iran in its attempt to take Herat, historically the western gateway to Afghanistan and northern India. In 1837 Iran advanced on Herat with the support and advice of Russian officers. The second immediate reason was the presence in Kabul in 1837 of a Russian agent, Captain P. Vitkevich, who was ostensibly there, as was the British agent Alexander Burnes, for commercial discussions.The British demanded that Dost Mohammad sever all contact with the Iranians and Russians, remove Vitkevich from Kabul, surrender all claims to Peshawar, and respect Peshawar's independence as well as that of Kandahar, which was under the control of his brothers at the time. In return, the British government intimated that it would ask Ranjit Singh to reconcile with the Afghans. When Auckland refused to put the agreement in writing, Dost Mohammad turned his back on the British and began negotiations with Vitkevich.In 1838 Auckland, Ranjit Singh, and Shuja signed an agreement stating that Shuja would regain control of Kabul and Kandahar with the help of the British and Sikhs; he would accept Sikh rule of the former Afghan provinces already controlled by Ranjit Singh, and that Herat would remain independent. In practice, the plan replaced Dost Mohammad with a British figurehead whose autonomy would be as limited as that of other Indian princes.It soon became apparent to the British that Sikh participation, advancing toward Kabul through the Khyber Pass while Shuja and the British advanced through Kandahar, would not be forthcoming. Auckland's plan in the spring of 1838 was for the Sikhs to place Shuja on the Afghan throne, with British support. By the end of the summer however, the plan had changed; now the British alone would impose the pliant Shuja Shah.First Anglo-Afghan War, 1838-1842.To justify his plan, the Governor-General of India Lord Auckland issued the Simla Manifesto in October 1838, setting forth the necessary reasons for British intervention in Afghanistan. The manifesto stated that in order to ensure the welfare of India, the British must have a trustworthy ally on India's western frontier. The British pretense that their troops were merely supporting Shah Shuja's small army in retaking what was once his throne fooled no one. Although the Simla Manifesto stated that British troops would be withdrawn as soon as Shuja was installed in Kabul, Shuja's rule depended entirely on British arms to suppress rebellion and on British funds to buy the support of tribal chiefs. The British denied that they were invading Afghanistan, instead claiming they were merely supporting its legitimate Shuja government \"against foreign interference and factious opposition\".In November 1841 insurrection and massacre flared up in Kabul. The British vacillated and disagreed and were beleaguered in their inadequate cantonments. The British negotiated with the most influential sirdars, cut off as they were by winter and insurgent tribes from any hope of relief. Muhammad Akbar Khan, son of the captive Dost Muhammad, arrived in Kabul and became effective leader of the sirdars. At a conference with them Sir William MacNaghten was killed, but in spite of this, the sirdars' demands were agreed to by the British and they withdrew. During the withdrawal they were attacked by Ghilzai tribesmen and in running battles through the snowbound passes nearly the entire column of 4,500 troops and 12,000 civilians were massacred. Of the British only one, Dr. William Brydon, reached Jalalabad, while a few others were captured.Afghan forces loyal to Akbar Khan besieged the remaining British contingents at Kandahar, Ghazni and Jalalabad. Ghazni fell, but the other garrisons held out, and with the help of reinforcements from India their besiegers were defeated. While preparations were under way for a renewed advance on Kabul, the new Governor-General Lord Ellenborough ordered British forces to leave Afghanistan after securing the release of the prisoners from Kabul and taking reprisals. The forces from Kandahar and Jalalabad again defeated Akbar Khan, retook Ghazni and Kabul, inflicted widespread devastation and rescued the prisoners before withdrawing through the Khyber Pass.Mid-nineteenth century.By 1854 the British wanted to resume relations with Dost Mohammad, whom they had essentially ignored in the intervening twelve years. The 1855 Treaty of Peshawar reopened diplomatic relations, proclaimed respect for each side's territorial integrity, and pledged both sides as friends of each other's friends and enemies of each other's enemies.In 1857 an addendum to the 1855 treaty permitted a British military mission to become a presence in Kandahar (but not Kabul) during a conflict with the Persians, who had attacked Herat in 1856. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, some British officials suggested restoring Peshawar to Dost Mohammad, in return for his support against the rebellious sepoys of the Bengal Army, but this view was rejected by British political officers on the North West frontier, who believed that Dost Mohammad would see this as a sign of weakness and turn against the British.In 1863 Dost Mohammad retook Herat with British acquiescence. A few months later, he died. Sher Ali Khan, his third son, and proclaimed successor, failed to recapture Kabul from his older brother, Mohammad Afzal (whose troops were led by his son, Abdur Rahman) until 1868, after which Abdur Rahman retreated across the Amu Darya and bided his time.In the years immediately following the First Anglo-Afghan War, and especially after the Indian rebellion of 1857 against the British in India, Liberal Party governments in London took a political view of Afghanistan as a buffer state. By the time Sher Ali had established control in Kabul in 1868, he found the British ready to support his regime with arms and funds, but nothing more. Over the next ten years, relations between the Afghan ruler and Britain deteriorated steadily. The Afghan ruler was worried about the southward encroachment of Russia, which by 1873 had taken over the lands of the khan, or ruler, of Khiva. Sher Ali sent an envoy seeking British advice and support. The previous year the British had signed an agreement with the Russians in which the latter agreed to respect the northern boundaries of Afghanistan and to view the territories of the Afghan amir as outside their sphere of influence. The British, however, refused to give any assurances to the disappointed Sher Ali.Second Anglo-Afghan War, 1878-1880.After tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 Congress of Berlin, Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali tried, but failed, to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878 and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.The amir not only refused to receive a British mission but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. Lord Lytton, the viceroy, ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass, triggering the Second Anglo-Afghan War. A British force of about 40,000 fighting men was distributed into military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. An alarmed Sher Ali attempted to appeal in person to the tsar for assistance, but unable to do so, he returned to Mazari Sharif, where he died on 21 February 1879.Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother Ayub Khan on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin Abdur Rahman Khan as emir instead. Ayub Khan, who had been serving as governor of Herat, rose in revolt, defeated a British detachment at the Battle of Maiwand in July 1880 and besieged Kandahar. Roberts then led the main British force from Kabul and decisively defeated Ayub Khan in September at the Battle of Kandahar, bringing his rebellion to an end. Abdur Rahman had confirmed the Treaty of Gandamak, leaving the British in control of the territories ceded by Yaqub Khan and ensuring British control of Afghanistan's foreign policy in exchange for protection and a subsidy. Abandoning the provocative policy of maintaining a British resident in Kabul, but having achieved all their other objectives, the British withdrew.The Iron Amir, 1880-1901.As far as British interests were concerned, Abdur Rahman answered their prayers: a forceful, intelligent leader capable of welding his divided people into a state; and he was willing to accept limitations to his power imposed by British control of his country's foreign affairs and the British buffer state policy. His twenty-one-year reign was marked by efforts to modernize and establish control of the kingdom, whose boundaries were delineated by the two empires bordering it. Abdur Rahman turned his considerable energies to what evolved into the creation of the modern state of Afghanistan.He achieved this consolidation of Afghanistan in three ways. He suppressed various rebellions and followed up his victories with harsh punishment, execution, and deportation. He broke the stronghold of Pashtun tribes by forcibly transplanting them. He transplanted his most powerful Pashtun enemies, the Ghilzai, and other tribes from southern and south-central Afghanistan to areas north of the Hindu Kush with predominantly non-Pashtun populations. The last non-Muslim Afghans of Kafiristan north of Kabul were forcefully converted to Islam. Finally, he created a system of provincial governorates different from old tribal boundaries. Provincial governors had a great deal of power in local matters, and an army was placed at their disposal to enforce tax collection and suppress dissent. Abdur Rahman kept a close eye on these governors, however, by creating an effective intelligence system. During his reign, tribal organization began to erode as provincial government officials allowed land to change hands outside the traditional clan and tribal limits.In addition to forging a nation from the splintered regions comprising Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman tried to modernize his kingdom by forging a regular army and the first institutionalized bureaucracy. Despite his distinctly authoritarian personality, Abdur Rahman called for a loya jirga, an assemblage of royal princes, important notables, and religious leaders. According to his autobiography, Abdur Rahman had three goals: subjugating the tribes, extending government control through a strong, visible army, and reinforcing the power of the ruler and the royal family.During his visit to Rawalpindi in 1885, the Amir requested the Viceroy of India to depute Muslim Envoy to Kabul having noble birth and of ruling family background. Mirza Atta Ullah Khan, Sardar Bahadur s\/o Khan Bahadur Mirza Fakir Ullah Khan (Saman Burj Wazirabad), a direct descendent of Jarral Rajput Rajas of Rajauri was selected and approved by the Amir to be the British Envoy to Kabul.Abdur Rahman also paid attention to technological advancement. He brought foreign physicians, engineers (especially for mining), geologists, and printers to Afghanistan. He imported European machinery and encouraged the establishment of small factories to manufacture soap, candles, and leather goods. He sought European technical advice on communications, transport, and irrigation. Local Afghan tribes strongly resisted this modernization. Workmen making roads had to be protected by the army against local warriors. Nonetheless, despite these sweeping internal policies, Abdur Rahman's foreign policy was completely in foreign hands.The first important frontier dispute was the Panjdeh crisis of 1885, precipitated by Russian encroachment into Central Asia. Having seized the Merv (now Mary) Oasis by 1884, Russian forces were directly adjacent to Afghanistan. Claims to the Panjdeh Oasis were in debate, with the Russians keen to take over all the region's Turkoman domains. After battling Afghan forces in the spring of 1885, the Russians seized the oasis. Russian and British troops were quickly alerted, but the two powers reached a compromise; Russia was in possession of the oasis, and Britain believed it could keep the Russians from advancing any farther. Without an Afghan say in the matter, the Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission agreed the Russians would relinquish the farthest territory captured in their advance but retain Panjdeh. This agreement on these border sections delineated for Afghanistan a permanent northern frontier at the Amu Darya but also the loss of much territory, especially around Panjdeh.The second section of Afghan border demarcated during Abdur Rahman's reign was in the Wakhan Corridor. The British insisted Abdur Rahman accept sovereignty over this remote region where unruly Kyrgyz held sway, he had no choice but to accept Britain's compromise. In 1895 and 1896 another Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission agreed on the frontier boundary to the far northeast of Afghanistan, which bordered Chinese territory (although the Chinese did not formally accept this as a boundary between the two countries until 1964.)For Abdur Rahman, delineating the boundary with India (through the Pashtun area) was far more significant, and it was during his reign that the Durand Line was drawn. Under pressure, Abdur Rahman agreed in 1893 to accept a mission headed by the British Indian foreign secretary, Sir Mortimer Durand, to define the limits of British and Afghan control in the Pashtun territories. Boundary limits were agreed on by Durand and Abdur Rahman before the end of 1893, but there is some question about the degree to which Abdur Rahman willingly ceded certain regions. There were indications that he regarded the Durand Line as a delimitation of separate areas of political responsibility, not a permanent international frontier, and that he did not explicitly cede control over certain parts (such as Kurram and Chitral) that were already in British control under the Treaty of Gandamak.The Durand Line cut through tribes and bore little relation to the realities of demography or military strategy. The line laid the foundation not for peace between the border regions, but for heated disagreement between the governments of Afghanistan and British India, and later, Afghanistan and Pakistan over what came to be known as the issue of Pashtunistan or 'Land of the Pashtuns'. (See Siege of Malakand).The clearest manifestation that Abdur Rahman had established control in Afghanistan was the peaceful succession of his eldest son, Habibullah Khan, to the throne on his father's death in October 1901. Although Abdur Rahman had fathered many children, he groomed Habibullah to succeed him, and he made it difficult for his other sons to contest the succession by keeping power from them and sequestering them in Kabul under his control.Habibullah Khan, Abdur Rahman Khan's eldest son and child of a slave mother, kept a close watch on the palace intrigues revolving around his father's more distinguished wife (a granddaughter of Dost Mohammad), who sought the throne for her own son. Although made secure in his position as ruler by virtue of support from the army which was created by his father, Habibullah was not as domineering as Abdur Rahman. Consequently, the influence of religious leaders as well as that of Mahmud Tarzi, a cousin of the king, increased during his reign. Mahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled poet and journalist, founded an Afghan nationalist newspaper with Habibullah's agreement, and until 1919 he used the newspaper as a platform for rebutting clerical criticism of Western-influenced changes in government and society, for espousing full Afghan independence, and for other reforms. Tarzi's passionate Afghan nationalism influenced a future generation of Asian reformers.The boundary with Iran was firmly delineated in 1904, replacing the ambiguous line made by a British commission in 1872.

However, harmful bacteria that may be in the \nsoil or water where produce grows can come in contact with \nfruits and vegetables and contaminate them. Fresh produce may \nalso become contaminated after it is harvested, such as during \nstorage or preparation. \nEating contaminated produce can lead to foodborne illness, often called \u201cfood poisoning.\u201d So as you enjoy fresh produce, follow \nthese safe handling tips to help protect yourself and your family.\nBuy Right Hand holding fruit in grocery store photo.\n\nYou can help keep produce safe \nby making wise buying decisions. \n\u2022\t\nChoose produce that is not bruised \nor damaged. \n\n\u2022\t\nWhen buying pre-cut, bagged or \npackaged produce \u2014 such as half \nof a watermelon or bagged salad \ngreens \u2014 choose only those items \nthat are refrigerated or surrounded by ice. \n\n\u2022\t\nBag fresh fruits and vegetables separately from raw meat, \npoultry, and seafood when packing them to take home from \nthe market. \n\n\nStore Properly  Produce in refererator with thermometer readin 40 degrees photo.\n\nProper storage of fresh produce \ncan affect both quality and safety.\n\u2022\t\nStore perishable fresh fruits and \nvegetables (like strawberries, lettuce, \nherbs, and mushrooms) in a clean \nrefrigerator at a temperature of \n40\u00b0 F or below. Use a refrigerator \nthermometer to check! If you\u2019re not \nsure whether an item should be \nrefrigerated to keep its quality, ask your grocer. \n\n\u2022\t\nRefrigerate all produce that is purchased pre-cut or packaged.\n\n\n\n\nSeparate for Safety   Seperate meat and vegetables on cutting boards photo.\n\nKeep fruits and vegetables that will be eaten raw separate from raw meat, poultry, and seafood \u2014 and from kitchen utensils used for \nthose products.  \n\u2022\t\nWash cutting boards, dishes, utensils, and countertops with soap and hot water between preparing raw meat, poultry, and seafood and preparing produce that will not be cooked. \n\n\u2022\t\nIf possible, use one cutting board for fresh produce and a separate one for raw meat, poultry, and seafood.\n\n\u2022\t\nIf you use plastic or other non-porous cutting boards, run them through the dishwasher after use.\n\n\nPrepare Safely    Hands washing produce in running sink water.\n\nWhen preparing any fresh produce, begin with clean hands. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water before and after preparation. \n\u2022\t\nCut away any damaged or bruised areas on fresh fruits and vegetables before preparing and\/or eating. Throw away any produce that looks rotten. \n\n\u2022\t\nWash all produce thoroughly under running water before preparing and\/or eating, including produce grown at home or bought from a grocery store or farmers\u2019 market. Washing fruits and vegetables with soap, detergent, or \ncommercial produce wash is not recommended. \n\n\u2022\t\nEven if you do not plan to eat the skin, it is still important to wash produce \nfirst so dirt and bacteria are not transferred from the surface when peeling \nor cutting produce. \n\n\u2022\t\nScrub firm produce, such as melons and cucumbers, with a clean \nproduce brush. \n\n\u2022\t\nAfter washing, dry produce with a clean cloth towel or paper towel to further reduce bacteria that may be present on the surface.\n\n\n\nWhat About Pre-Washed Produce?\nMany pre-cut, bagged, or packaged produce items are pre-washed and ready-to-eat. If so, it will be stated on the packaging, and you can use the produce without further washing. \nIf you choose to wash produce marked as \u201cpre-washed\u201d or \n\u201cready-to-eat,\u201d be sure that it does not come in contact with unclean surfaces or utensils. This will help to avoid cross contamination.\n\nPre-washed saled bag photo.\n\nSprouts on a sndwich photo.\nSprouts: What You Should Know\nLike any fresh produce that is consumed raw or lightly cooked, sprouts that are served on salads, wraps, sandwiches, and in some Asian food may contain bacteria that can cause foodborne illness. But unlike other fresh produce, sprouts are grown from seeds and beans under warm and humid conditions. These conditions are also ideal for the growth of bacteria, including Salmonella, Listeria, and E. coli. If just a few harmful bacteria are present in or on the seed, the bacteria can grow to high levels during sprouting, even if you are growing your own sprouts under sanitary conditions at home.\nChildren, older adults, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems \n(such as transplant patients and individuals with HIV\/AIDS, cancer, or diabetes) should avoid eating raw or lightly cooked sprouts of any kind (including onion, alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean sprouts). When eating out, you can ask that raw sprouts not be added to your food. If you purchase a sandwich or salad at a restaurant or delicatessen, check to make sure that raw sprouts have not been added.\nWhat can consumers do to reduce the risk of illness if they want to eat sprouts? \n\u2022\t\nWash sprouts thoroughly under running water before eating or cooking. Washing may reduce bacteria that may be present, but it will not eliminate it.\n\n\u2022\t\nCook sprouts thoroughly. Cooking kills harmful bacteria and reduces the risk of illness. \n\n\n\nAbout Foodborne Illness \nKnow the Symptoms\nConsuming dangerous foodborne bacteria will usually cause illness within 1 to 3 days of eating the contaminated food. However, sickness can also occur within 20 minutes or up to 6 weeks \nlater. Although most people will recover from a foodborne illness within a short period of time, some can develop chronic, severe, or even life-threatening health problems.\nFoodborne illness can sometimes be confused with other illnesses that have similar symptoms. \nThe symptoms of foodborne illness can include: \n\u2022\t\nVomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain \n\n\u2022\t\nFlu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and body ache \n\n\nTake Action\nIf you think that you or a family member has a foodborne illness, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Also, report the suspected foodborne illness to FDA in either of these ways: \n\u2022\t\nContact the Consumer Complaint Coordinator in your area. Locate a coordinator here: \nhttp:\/\/www.fda.gov\/Safety\/ReportaProblem\/ConsumerComplaintCoordinators \n\n\u2022\t\nContact MedWatch, FDA\u2019s Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program: \nBy Phone: 1-800-FDA-1088 \nOnline: File a voluntary report at http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medwatch \n\n\n\n\nSafe Food Handling: Four Simple Steps\n\nClean Separate Cook Chill 4C icons. \nCLEAN \nWash hands and surfaces often\n\n\tWash your hands with warm water and soap for at least \n20 seconds before and after handling food and after \nusing the bathroom, changing diapers, and handling pets.\n\tWash your cutting boards, dishes, utensils, and counter tops with hot soapy water after preparing each food item.\n\tConsider using paper towels to clean up kitchen \nsurfaces. If you use cloth towels, launder them often in the hot cycle.\n\tRinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running tap \nwater, including those with skins and rinds that are not \neaten. Scrub firm produce with a clean produce brush.\n\tWith canned goods, remember to clean lids before \nopening.\n\nSEPARATE \nSeparate raw meats from other foods\n\n  Separate raw meat, poultry, seafood, and \neggs from other foods in your grocery \nshopping cart, grocery bags, and refrigerator.\n  Use one cutting board for fresh produce \nand a separate one for raw meat, poultry, \nand seafood.\n  Never place cooked food on a plate that \npreviously held raw meat, poultry, seafood, \nor eggs unless the plate has been washed in \nhot, soapy water.\n  Don\u2019t reuse marinades used on raw foods \nunless you bring them to a boil first.\n\nCOOK \nCook to the right temperature\n\n\tColor and texture are unreliable indicators of safety. \nUsing a food thermometer is the only way to ensure the safety of meat, poultry, seafood, and egg products for \nall cooking methods. These foods must be cooked to \na safe minimum internal temperature to destroy any \nharmful bacteria.\n\tCook eggs until the yolk and white are firm. Only use recipes in which eggs are cooked or heated thoroughly.\n\tWhen cooking in a microwave oven, cover food, stir, \nand rotate for even cooking. If there is no turntable, rotate the dish by hand once or twice during cooking. Always allow standing time, which completes the \ncooking, before checking the internal temperature with \na food thermometer. \n\tBring sauces, soups and gravy to a boil when reheating.\n\nCHILL \nRefrigerate foods promptly\n\n\tUse an appliance thermometer to be sure the \ntemperature is consistently 40\u00b0 F or below and \nthe freezer temperature is 0\u00b0 F or below.\n\tRefrigerate or freeze meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, \nand other perishables within 2 hours of cooking \nor purchasing. Refrigerate within 1 hour if the \ntemperature outside is above 90\u00b0 F.\n\tNever thaw food at room temperature, such as on the counter top. There are three safe ways to defrost food: in the refrigerator, in cold water, and \nin the microwave. Food thawed in cold water or in the microwave should be cooked immediately.\n\tAlways marinate food in the refrigerator.\n\tDivide large amounts of leftovers into shallow \ncontainers for quicker cooling in the refrigerator.\n\nNovember 2015\n\nFor more information, contact the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\u2019s Food and Cosmetic \nInformation Center at 1-888-SAFEFOOD (toll free), Monday through Friday 10 AM to 4 PM ET (except Thursdays from 12 PM to 1 PM ET \nand Federal Holidays).

Construction began in 1911 and was completed in 1913. It was named after Nathanael Burwash, a former president of Victoria. The building is an extravagant Neo-Gothic work with turrets, gargoyles, and battlements. The architect was Henry Sproatt.The building is divided between the large dining hall in the northwest and the student residence proper. The residence area is divided into two sections. The Upper Houses, built in 1913, consist of four houses: North House, Middle House, Gate House, and South House. The Lower Houses were built in 1931 and were originally intended to house theology students at Emmanuel College, whose current building was opened the same year. Ryerson House, Nelles House, Caven House, Bowles-Gandier House are now mostly home to undergraduate arts and science students. The latter two are mostly reserved for students in the new Vic One Programme.Famous residents of Burwash include Vincent Massey, Lester B. Pearson, Don Harron, and Donald Sutherland. The upper houses were gutted and renovated in 1995. The lower houses have only been partially upgraded. Before the renovations the entire building was all male, but now every house is co-ed.Each Upper House consists of three floors. The lower floor contains a common room equipped with kitchen facilities, couches and a television. The upper floors each have their own kitchen and dining area. All except North House have a very high bathroom ratio, with Gate House being the best with nine washrooms for its twenty-eight residents. Upper Houses are divided between double rooms and singles, with about sixty percent of the population being in doubles.The Lower Houses each have four floors, but are much narrower with each level having only four rooms. Each level also has its own kitchen, but these are much smaller than in the Upper Houses. The Lower Houses do have far larger and better fitted common rooms that are similar to the one's the Upper Houses had before the renovations. The rooms in the Lower Houses are also considered more luxurious with hardwood floors and large sizes. Rooms in the Lower Houses are more expensive, however. Until 2003 the Lower Houses were restricted to upper year students but with the double cohort of graduates from Ontario schools many of the rooms were transformed into doubles and now hold first years.To the west the Upper Houses look out on the Vic Quad and the main Victoria College building across it. West of the Lower Houses is the new Lester B. Pearson Garden of Peace and International Understanding and the E.J. Pratt Library beyond it. From the eastern side of the building, the Upper Houses look out at Rowell Jackman Hall and the Lower Houses see the St. Michael's College residence of Elmsley. The only exception is the view from Gate House's tower that looks down St. Mary's Street.The dining hall is perhaps the best known part of the building to outsiders. It is the University of Toronto's largest holding some 250 students and sixteen large tables. Hanging on the western wall is Queen Victoria's burial flag, given to the college soon after her death. Under the flag is the high table where the professors and college administration lunch. Historically, the Upper Houses each had their own table. Gate sat in the southwest corner, Middle sat in the far northeast, South sat in the table to the west of Middle, while North sat to the west of the southeast corner. The only lower house to have had a designated table wass Caven, in the northwest corner beside the Alumni table. (Note that prior to the 1995 renovations, some of these houses, particularly North and Caven, 'traditionally' sat elsewhere)<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q58","QuestionID":"QID58"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID209","SecondaryAttribute":"Foreign relations of Cameroon.Cameroon's noncontentious, low-profile approach to foreign relation...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Foreign relations of Cameroon.Cameroon's noncontentious, low-profile approach to foreign relations puts it squarely in the middle of other African and developing country states on major issues.

Five years later, having grown by 33 centimetres, he made his Serie A debut with Udinese, though Zoff made only four appearances for Udinese before moving to Mantova in 1963.In 1968, Zoff was transferred to Napoli. In the same year he made his debut for Italy, playing against Bulgaria in the quarter final of the 1968 European Championships. Italy proceeded to win the tournament, Zoff taking home a winners' medal after only his fourth international appearance.Coaching career.After his retirement as a player, Zoff went into coaching, joining the technical staff at Juventus, where he was head coach from 1988 to 1990. In 1990 he was sacked, despite winning the UEFA Cup. He then joined Lazio, where he became president in 1994.In 1998 Zoff was appointed coach of the Italian national team. Using a more open and attacking style than usually used by Italian sides, he coached Italy to a second-place finish in Euro 2000, suffering a cruel extra-time defeat at the hands of France in the final, when in the 90th minute of the game, Italy were 1-0 up and less than sixty seconds from winning the tournament before France scored to equalise and go to extra time.

Gas leavesthebodywhenpeopleburpthroughthe mouthorpassgasthroughtheanus. \nGas is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sometimes methane. Flatus, gas passed through the anus, may also contain small amounts of gasses that contain sulfur. Flatus that contains more sulfur gasses has more odor. \nEveryone has gas. However, many people think they burp or pass gas too often and that they have too much gas. Having too much gas is rare. \n\nWhat causes gas? \nGas in the digestive tract is usually caused by swallowing air and by the breakdown of certain foods in the large intestine by bacteria. \nEveryone swallowsa small amountofair when eating and drinking.

The remaining gas moves into the small intestine, where it is partially absorbed. Asmall amount travels into the large intestine for release through the anus. \nThe stomach and small intestine do not fully digest some carbohydrates\u2014sugars, starches, and fiber found in many foods. This undigested food passes through the small intestine to the large intestine. Once there, undigested carbohydrates are broken down by bacteria in the large intestine, which release hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the process. Other types of bacteria in the large intestine take in hydrogen gas and create methane gas or hydrogen sulfide, the most common sulfur gas in flatus. \nStudies have detected methane in the breath of 30 to 62 percent of healthy adults.1 A larger percentage of adults may produce methane in the intestines, but the levels may be too low to be detected. Research suggests that people with conditions that cause constipation are more likely to produce detectable amounts of methane.1 More research is needed to find out the reasons for differences in methane production and to explore the relationship between methane and other health problems. \n1SahakianAB,JeeSR,PimentelM. Methaneandthe gastrointestinal tract. Digestive Diseases and Sciences. 2010;55(8):2135\u201343. Epub 2009 Oct 15. Some of the gas produced in the intestines is absorbedby the bloodstream and carried to the lungs, where it is released in the breath. \nNormally, few bacteria live in the small intestine. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is usually related to diseases or disorders that damage the digestive system or affect how it works, such as Crohn\u2019s disease\u2014an inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation, or swelling, and irritation of any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract\u2014or diabetes. \n\nWhich foods cause gas? \nMost foods that contain carbohydrates can cause gas. In contrast, fats and proteins cause little gas. Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in someone else, depending on how well individuals digest carbohydrates and the type of bacteria present in the intestines. \nSome foods that may cause gas include \n\u2022 \nbeans \n\n\u2022 \nvegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, onions, mushrooms, artichokes, and asparagus \n\n\u2022 \nfruits such as pears, apples, and peaches \n\n\u2022 \nwhole grains such as whole wheat and bran \n\n\u2022 \nsodas; fruit drinks, especially apple juice and pear juice; and other drinks that contain high-fructose corn syrup,a sweetener made from corn \n\n\u2022 \nmilk and milk products such as cheese, ice cream, and yogurt \n\n\u2022 \npackaged foods\u2014such as bread, cereal, and salad dressing\u2014that contain small amountsof lactose,a sugar foundin milk and foods made with milk \n\n\u2022 \nsugar-free candies and gums that contain sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol \n\n\n\nWhat are the symptoms of gas? \nThe most common symptoms of gas are burping, passing gas, bloating, and abdominal pain or discomfort. However, not everyone experiences these symptoms. \nBurping. Burping,or belching, onceina while, especially during and after meals, is normal. However, people who burp frequently may be swallowing too much air and releasing it before the air enters the stomach. \nSome people who burp frequently may have an upper GI disorder, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease\u2014a chronic condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus. People may believe that swallowing air and releasing it will relieve the discomfort, and they may intentionally or unintentionally developa habit of burping to relieve discomfort. \nPassing gas. Passing gas around 13 to 21 timesadayis normal.2 Flatulenceis excessive gas in the stomach or intestine that can cause bloating and flatus. Flatulence may be the result of problems digesting certain carbohydrates. \n2Gas-related complaints. The Merck Manuals Online Medical Library. www.merckmanuals.com\/ professional\/sec02\/ch008\/ch008d.html. Updated October 2007. Accessed June 26, 2012. Bloating. Bloatingisa feelingof fullnessand swelling in the abdomen, the area between the chest and hips. Problems digesting carbohydrates may cause increased gas and bloating. However, bloating is not always caused by too much gas. Bloating may result from diseases that affect how gas moves through the intestines, such as rapid gastric emptying, or from diseases that cause intestinal obstruction, such as colon cancer. People who have had many operations, internal hernias, or bands of internal scar tissue called adhesions may experience bloating. \nDisorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can affect how gas moves through the intestines or increase pain sensitivity inthe intestines. IBSisa functionalGI disorder, meaning that the symptoms are caused by changes in how the digestive tract works. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both. IBS may give a sensation of bloating because of increased sensitivity to normal amounts of gas. \nEatingalotoffattyfoodcandelay stomach emptying and cause bloating and discomfort, but not necessarily too much gas. \nAbdominal pain and discomfort. People may feel abdominal pain or discomfort when gas does not move through the intestines normally. People with IBS may be more sensitive to gas and feel pain when gas is present in the intestines. \n\nHow is the cause of gas found? \nPeople can try to find the cause of gas on their ownby keepinga diaryof what they eat and drink and how often they burp, pass gas, or have other symptoms. Adiary may help identify specific foods that cause gas. \nAhealth care provider should be consulted if \n\u2022 \nsymptoms of gas are bothersome \n\n\u2022 \nsymptoms change suddenly \n\n\u2022 \nnew symptoms occur, especially in\n people older than age 40\n \n\n\u2022 \ngasis accompaniedby other symptoms, such as constipation, diarrhea, or weight loss \n\n\nThe health care provider will ask about dietary habits and symptoms and may ask a person to keepa food diary. Careful review of diet and the amount of burping or gas passed may help relate specific foods to symptoms and determine the severity of the problem. Recording gas symptoms can help determine whether the problem is too much gas in the intestines or increased sensitivity to normal amounts of gas. \nIf milk or milk products are causing gas, the health care provider may perform blood or breath tests to check for lactose intolerance, the inability or insufficient ability to digest lactose.Lactose intoleranceis causedbya deficiency of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to digest lactose. The health care provider may suggest avoiding milk products fora short timeto seeif symptoms improve. \nThe health care provider may perform a physical exam and order other types of diagnostic tests, depending ona person\u2019s symptoms. These tests can rule out serious health problems that may cause gas or symptoms similar to those of gas. \n\nHow is gas treated? \nGas can be treated by reducing swallowed air, making dietary changes, or taking over.the-counter or prescription medications. People who think they have too much gas can try to treat gas on their own before seeing a health care provider. Health care providers can provide advice about reducing gas and prescribe medications that may help. \nReducing swallowed air. Swallowing less air may help reduce gas, especially for people who burp frequently. Ahealth care provider may suggest eating more slowly, avoiding gum and hard candies, or checking witha dentist to make sure dentures fit correctly. \nMaking dietary changes. Peoplemaybeable toreducegasbyeatinglessofthefoodsthat causegas. However,manyhealthyfoodsmay causegas,suchasfruitsandvegetables,whole grains,andmilkproducts. Theamountofgas causedbycertainfoodsvariesfrompersonto person. Effectivedietarychangesdependon learningthroughtrialanderrorwhichfoods causeapersontohavegasandhowmuchof theoffendingfoodsonecanhandle. \nWhile fat does not cause gas, limiting high-fat foods can help reduce bloating and discomfort. Less fat in the diet helps the stomach empty faster, allowing gases to move more quickly into the small intestine. \nTaking over-the-counter medications. Some over-the-countermedicationscanhelpreduce gasorthesymptomsassociatedwithgas: \n\u2022 \nAlpha-galactosidase (Beano), an over.the-counter digestive aid, contains the sugar-digesting enzyme that the body lacks to digest the sugar in beans and many vegetables. The enzyme comes in liquid and tablet form. Five drops are added per serving or one tablet is swallowed just before eating to break down the gas-producing sugars. Beano has no effect on gas caused by lactose or fiber. \n\n\u2022 \nSimethicone (Gas-X, Mylanta Gas) can relieve bloating and abdominal pain or discomfort causedby gas. \n\n\u2022 \nLactase tablets or drops can help people with lactose intolerance digest milk and milk products to reduce gas. Lactase tablets are taken just before eating foods that contain lactose; lactase drops can be added to liquid milk products. Lactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products are available at most grocery stores. \n\n\nTaking prescription medications. Health care providers may prescribe medications to help reduce symptoms, especially for people with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or IBS. For more information about IBS, see the Irritable Bowel Syndrome fact sheet from the National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse at www.digestive.niddk.nih.gov. \n\nEating, Diet, and Nutrition \nPeople\u2019s eating habits and diet affect the amount of gas they have. For example, eating and drinking too fast may increase the amount of air swallowed, and foods that contain carbohydrates may cause some people to have more gas. \nTracking eating habits and symptoms can help identify the foods that cause more gas. Avoiding or eating less of these foods may help reduce gas symptoms. \n\nPoints to Remember \n\u2022 \nGas is air in the digestive tract. \n\n\u2022 \nEveryone has gas. However, many people think they pass gas too often and that they have too much gas. Having too much gas is rare. \n\n\u2022 \nGas in the digestive tract is usually causedby swallowingairandbythe breakdown of certain foods in the large intestineby bacteria. \n\n\u2022 \nMost foods that contain carbohydrates can cause gas.

The philosopher Johann Georg Hamann is considered to be the ideologue of Sturm und Drang, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was a notable proponent of the movement, though he and Friedrich Schiller ended their period of association with it, initiating what would become Weimar Classicism.German Classicism.Romanticism.German Romanticism was the dominant movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. German Romanticism developed relatively late compared to its English counterpart, coinciding in its early years with the movement known as German Classicism or Weimar Classicism, which it opposed. In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety is notable for valuing humor and wit as well as beauty. The early German romantics tried to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, looking to the Middle Ages as a simpler, more integrated period. As time went on, however, they became increasingly aware of the tenuousness of the unity they were seeking. Later German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the everyday world and the seemingly irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius. Heinrich Heine in particular criticized the tendency of the early romantics to look to the medieval past for a model of unity in art and society.Nazi Germany.Under the Nazi regime, some authors went into exile (\"Exilliteratur\") and others submitted to censorship (\"internal emigration\", \"Innere Emigration\")Nobel Prize laureates.The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to German language authors thirteen times (as of 2009), or the third most often after English and French language authors (with 27 and 14 laureates, respectively).<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"German language literature.German literature comprises those literary texts written in the German...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div><div>Cluny.The town grew up around the Benedictine Cluny Abbey, founded by Duke William I of Aquitaine in A.D. 910.

But it hasnt forgotten its humble beginnings in Search. The company has now launched an update that should make searching on Google a much more personalized experience.<\/p><p>&nbsp;The update was initially announced in July, whereupon it was only made available to U.S. users. But now, its available to everyone around the world. At the core of the update is the feed, or the stream of information youll get when you head to the Google app or the formerly named Google Now section on your Google Pixel or Pixel XL smartphone. You wont see the changes when you head to the Google website on your desktop just yet&nbsp; though the company says that its working on bringing the update to browsers at some point in the near future.<\/p><p>&nbsp;The feed itself was first introduced back in December as a part of the Google app, and the company has slowly been increasing the types of content you see. So what exactly is changing? Well, the feed is about to become more personalized, and youll be in the drivers seat for that personalization. Youll now be able to follow or unfollow individual topics, and the feed will pull in information based on those interests.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Dive deeper<\/p><p>&nbsp;First up is the ability to dive deeper. In other words, the feed will help users explore topics theyre interested in, beyond simply reading an article Google presents in the feed. You can tap the header of the card in the Google app to search the relevant topic on Google. From there, as with any search result, youll be able to see things like recent news about the topic, related articles, and so on.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Google is also attempting to helping people find multiple different perspectives on a particular topic. How? Well, when youre presented with a news article, you might see a small carousel section underneath showing other related articles from other publications.<\/p><p>&nbsp;New to you<\/p><p>&nbsp;Google will now present content that it calls new-to-you. In other words, that content might not be new on the web, but it might be related to a new interest of yours. If, for example, you start learning the guitar and search about the instrument on the web, Google might pick up on that new interest and present a guide on how to string your guitar that was written two years ago. Not new content&nbsp; but newly important to you.<\/p><p>&nbsp;The changes so far have been about Google picking up on your interests&nbsp; but you can also explicitly tell Google about an interest of yours with a new Follow button that will show up on topic cards in Google Search. The button is located in an easy-to-find spot on the top left of the card, and once you tap it youll immediately start seeing related content in the feed. For example, you might watch Christopher Nolans latest film Dunkirk, and find youre interested in Harry Styles, whos in the film. Simply search Harry Styles, and youll then find the Follow button, which you can tap on. Its as easy to unfollow him if you find too many articles related to One Direction in your feed.<\/p><p>&nbsp;While weve been getting better at understanding your interests, it hasnt always been easy for you to choose new topics for your feed, said Google in a blog post. To help you keep up with exactly what you care about, youll now be able to follow topics, right from Search results. Look out for a new FOLLOW button next to certain types of search resultsincluding movies, sports teams, your favorite bands or music artists, famous people, and more.<\/p><p>&nbsp;All this might sound a little familiar. Google Now has been personal to you for years now. But Google sees this as more of a natural evolution of Now rather than anything groundbreakingly new.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Were fine-tuning and improving all of those interest signals, Emily Moxley, product manager for Search, told Digital Trends. So weve worked a fair amount on ensuring that those algorithms work really really well. Plus, if you see an article that interests you can deep dive into that entire topic.<\/p><p>&nbsp;If successful, the system could one day be used for advertising&nbsp; though the company says that it has nothing to share about advertising in the feed at this point.<\/p><p>&nbsp;The update to the feed is available in both the Android and iOS version of the Google app, and Google Pixel owners will be able to experience the updated feed by swiping left on their home screen. The company is also working on extending the features to both the Google homepage and to mobile web.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Update: Google Feed updates are now available to everyone around the world.&nbsp;<\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q553","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Google is making it much easier to find content that is relevant to you and you alone -- so there...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID553","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID545","SecondaryAttribute":"Google Project Zero continues to scrape away at the ubiquitous Microsoft Malware Protection Engin...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<p>Google Project Zero continues to scrape away at the ubiquitous Microsoft Malware Protection Engine at the core of many security products embedded in Windows, and it continues to discover new critical vulnerabilities.<\/p><p>&nbsp;The latest, another remote code execution flaw, was patched on Friday after it was privately disclosed June 7 by researcher Tavis Ormandy.<\/p><p>&nbsp;The vulnerability was found in the same full system, unsandboxed x86 system emulator that Microsoft quietly patch in late May.

Ormandy said that an apicall instruction, which invokes a large number of emulator apis is exposed remotely; the researcher said Microsoft told him that the apicall instruction is exposed intentionally for multiple reasons.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Microsoft said the vulnerability exists because MsMpEng does not properly scan a specially crafted file, leading to memory corruption.<\/p><p>&nbsp;An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system, Microsoft said in an advisory.

Attackers could also deliver the exploit via email or IM, again executing the attack if MsMpEng automatically scans it.<\/p><p>&nbsp;If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned, Microsoft said. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited.

The name continues in some usages, although it is today considered geologically imprecise as it combines features that are today regarded as separate, although related, rift and fault systems. Today, the term is most often used to refer to the valley of the East African Rift, the divergent plate boundary which extends from the Afar Triple Junction southward across eastern Africa, and is in the process of splitting the African Plate into two new separate plates. Geologists generally refer to these incipient plates as the Nubian Plate and the Somali Plate.Geography.The Great Rift Valley as originally described extends from Lebanon in the north to Mozambique in the south, and constitutes one of two distinct physiographic provinces of the East African mountains physiographic division.Sinai peninsula.The northernmost part of the Rift, today called the Dead Sea Transform or Rift, forms the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon separating the Lebanon Mountains and Anti-Lebanon Mountains. Further south it is known as the Hula Valley separating the Galilee mountains and the Golan Heights. The River Jordan begins here and flows southward through Lake Hula into the Sea of Galilee in Israel, then continues south through the Jordan Rift Valley into the Dead Sea on the Israeli-Jordanian border. From the Dead Sea southwards, the Rift is occupied by the Wadi Arabah, then the Gulf of Aqaba, and then the Red Sea. Off the southern tip of Sinai in the Red Sea, the Dead Sea Transform meets the Red Sea Rift which runs the length of the Red Sea. The Red Sea Rift comes ashore to meet the East African Rift and the Aden Ridge in the Afar Depression of East Africa. The junction of these three rifts is called the Afar Triple Junction.Africa.In eastern Africa, the valley divides into two, the Northern Rift Valley and the Southern Rift Valley.The Western Rift, also called the Albertine Rift, is edged by some of the highest mountains in Africa, including the Virunga Mountains, Mitumba Mountains, and Ruwenzori Range. It contains the Rift Valley lakes, which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to 1,470 metres deep at Lake Tanganyika). Much of this area lies within the boundaries of national parks such as Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwenzori National Park and Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda, and Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. Lake Victoria, the second largest area freshwater lake in the world, is considered part of the Rift Valley system although it actually lies between the two branches. All of the African Great Lakes were formed as the result of the rift, and most lie within its rift valley.In Kenya, the valley is deepest to the north of Nairobi. As the lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind. For example, Lake Magadi has high concentrations of soda (sodium carbonate) and Lake Elmenteita, Lake Bogoria, and Lake Nakuru are all strongly alkaline, while the freshwater springs supplying Lake Naivasha are essential to support its current biological variety.Discoveries in human evolution.The Rift Valley in East Africa has been a rich source of fossilsthat allow study of human evolution, especially in an area known as Piedmont.Because the rapidly eroding highlands have filled the valley with sediments, a favorable environment for the preservation of remains has been created. The bones of several hominid ancestors of modern humans have been found there, including those of \"Lucy\", a partial, yet eye-opening australopithecine skeleton, which was discovered by anthropologist Donald Johanson dating back over 3 million years. Richard and Mary Leakey have also done significant work in this region.More recently, two other hominid ancestors have been discovered there: a 10 million year-old ape called \"Chororapithecus abyssinicus\", found in the Afar rift, in eastern Ethiopia, and the \"Nakalipithecus nakayamai\", which is also 10 million years old.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Great Rift Valley.The Great Rift Valley is a name given in the late 19th century by British explo...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div><div><div>Database normalization.Edgar F. Codd, the inventor of the relational model, introduced the concept of normalization and what we now know as the First Normal Form (1NF) in 1970. Codd went on to define the Second Normal Form (2NF) and Third Normal Form (3NF) in 1971, and Codd and Raymond F. Boyce defined the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) in 1974. Higher normal forms were defined by other theorists in subsequent years, the most recent being the Sixth normal form (6NF) introduced by Chris Date, Hugh Darwen, and Nikos Lorentzos in 2002.Informally, a relational database table (the computerized representation of a relation) is often described as \"normalized\" if it is in the Third Normal Form. Most 3NF tables are free of insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, i.e. in most cases 3NF tables adhere to BCNF, 4NF, and 5NF (but typically not 6NF).A standard piece of database design guidance is that the designer should create a fully normalized design; selective denormalization can subsequently be performed for performance reasons. However, some modeling disciplines, such as the dimensional modeling approach to data warehouse design, explicitly recommend non-normalized designs, i.e. designs that in large part do not adhere to 3NF.Objectives of normalization.For example, in order to find out the monetary sum of all transactions that occurred in October 2003 for all customers, the system would have to know that it must first unpack the \"Transactions\" group of each customer, then sum the \"Amounts\" of all transactions thus obtained where the \"Date\" of the transaction falls in October 2003.Now each row represents an individual credit card transaction, and the DBMS can obtain the answer of interest, simply by finding all rows with a Date falling in October, and summing their Amounts. All of the values in the data structure are on an equal footing: they are all exposed to the DBMS directly, and can directly participate in queries, whereas in the previous situation some values were embedded in lower-level structures that had to be handled specially. Accordingly, the normalized design lends itself to general-purpose query processing, whereas the unnormalized design does not.The sections below give details of each of these objectives.Minimize redesign when extending the database structure.When a fully normalized database structure is extended to allow it to accommodate new types of data, the pre-existing aspects of the database structure can remain largely or entirely unchanged. As a result, applications interacting with the database are minimally affected.Make the data model more informative to users.Normalized tables, and the relationship between one normalized table and another, mirror real-world concepts and their interrelationships.Avoid bias towards any particular pattern of querying.Normalized tables are suitable for general-purpose querying. This means any queries against these tables, including future queries whose details cannot be anticipated, are supported. In contrast, tables that are not normalized lend themselves to some types of queries, but not others.Background to normalization: definitions.Normal forms.The normal forms (abbrev. NF) of relational database theory provide criteria for determining a table's degree of vulnerability to logical inconsistencies and anomalies. The higher the normal form applicable to a table, the less vulnerable it is to inconsistencies and anomalies. Each table has a \"highest normal form\" (HNF): by definition, a table always meets the requirements of its HNF and of all normal forms lower than its HNF; also by definition, a table fails to meet the requirements of any normal form higher than its HNF.The normal forms are applicable to individual tables; to say that an entire database is in normal form \"n\" is to say that all of its tables are in normal form \"n\".Newcomers to database design sometimes suppose that normalization proceeds in an iterative fashion, i.e. a 1NF design is first normalized to 2NF, then to 3NF, and so on. This is not an accurate description of how normalization typically works. A sensibly designed table is likely to be in 3NF on the first attempt; furthermore, if it is 3NF, it is overwhelmingly likely to have an HNF of 5NF. Achieving the \"higher\" normal forms (above 3NF) does not usually require an extra expenditure of effort on the part of the designer, because 3NF tables usually need no modification to meet the requirements of these higher normal forms.The main normal forms are summarized below.Denormalization.Databases intended for online transaction processing (OLTP) are typically more normalized than databases intended for online analytical processing (OLAP). OLTP applications are characterized by a high volume of small transactions such as updating a sales record at a supermarket checkout counter. The expectation is that each transaction will leave the database in a consistent state. By contrast, databases intended for OLAP operations are primarily \"read mostly\" databases. OLAP applications tend to extract historical data that has accumulated over a long period of time. For such databases, redundant or \"denormalized\" data may facilitate business intelligence applications. Specifically, dimensional tables in a star schema often contain denormalized data. The denormalized or redundant data must be carefully controlled during extract, transform, load (ETL) processing, and users should not be permitted to see the data until it is in a consistent state. The normalized alternative to the star schema is the snowflake schema. In many cases, the need for denormalization has waned as computers and RDBMS software have become more powerful, but since data volumes have generally increased along with hardware and software performance, OLAP databases often still use denormalized schemas.Denormalization is also used to improve performance on smaller computers as in computerized cash-registers and mobile devices, since these may use the data for look-up only (e.g. price lookups). Denormalization may also be used when no RDBMS exists for a platform (such as Palm), or no changes are to be made to the data and a swift response is crucial.In recognition that denormalization can be deliberate and useful, the non-first normal form is a definition of database designs which do not conform to first normal form, by allowing \"sets and sets of sets to be attribute domains\" (Schek 1982). The languages used to query and manipulate data in the model must be extended accordingly to support such values.One way of looking at this is to consider such structured values as being specialized types of values (domains), with their own domain-specific languages. However, what is usually meant by non-1NF models is the approach in which the relational model and the languages used to query it are extended with a general mechanism for such structure; for instance, the nested relational model supports the use of relations as domain values, by adding two additional operators (\"nest\" and \"unnest\") to the relational algebra that can create and flatten nested relations, respectively.Although \"unnest\" is the mathematical inverse to \"nest\", the operator \"nest\" is not always the mathematical inverse of \"unnest\". Another constraint required is for the operators to be bijective, which is covered by the Partitioned Normal Form (PNF).<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q134","QuestionID":"QID134"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID138","SecondaryAttribute":"Habitus (sociology).Habitus is a complex concept, but in its simplest usage could be understood a...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div><div><div><div><div>Habitus (sociology).Habitus is a complex concept, but in its simplest usage could be understood as a structure of the mind characterized by a set of acquired schemata, sensibilities, dispositions and taste. The particular contents of the habitus are the result of the objectification of social structure at the level of individual subjectivity. Hence, the habitus is, by definition, isomorphic with the structural conditions in which it emerged.The concept of habitus has been used as early as Aristotle but in contemporary usage was introduced by Marcel Mauss and later re-elaborated by Pierre Bourdieu.Origin of concept.Mauss defined habitus as those aspects of culture that are anchored in the body or daily practices of individuals, groups, societies, and nations. It includes the totality of learned habits, bodily skills, styles, tastes, and other non-discursive knowledges that might be said to \"go without saying\" for a specific group -- in that way it can be said to operate beneath the level of rational ideology.Habitus in Bourdieu's social theory.Bourdieu re-elaborated the concept of habitus from Marcel Mauss and extended the scope of the term to include a person's beliefs and dispositions. He used it, in a more or less systematic way, in an attempt to resolve a prominent antinomy of the human sciences: objectivism and subjectivism.The habitus provides the practical skills and dispositions necessary to navigate within different fields (such as sports, professional life, art) and guides the choices of the individual without ever being strictly reducible to prescribed, formal rules. At the same time, the habitus is constantly remade by these navigations and choices (including the success or failure of previous actions).Defenders of Bourdieu argue that such critics have misunderstood and exaggerated the conservative extent of \"habitus\" in Bourdieu. Bourdieu allows agency its location within the bounded structures of society and self. And, Bourdieu advocates a method for researchers to include diverse cultural voices in their work.Body Habitus.Body habitus is the medical term for physique, and is defined as either endomorphic (overweight), ectomorphic (underweight) or mesomorphic (normal weight). In this sense, habitus can be understood as the physical and constitutional characteristics of an individual, especially as related to the tendency to develop a certain disease.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Habitus (sociology).Habitus is a complex concept, but in its simplest usage could be understood a...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div><div><div><div>Great Rift Valley.The Great Rift Valley is a name given in the late 19th century by British explorer John Walter Gregory to the continuous geographic trench, approximately in length, that runs from northern Syria in Southwest Asia to central Mozambique in East Africa.

Much of this area lies within the boundaries of national parks such as Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwenzori National Park and Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda, and Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. Lake Victoria, the second largest area freshwater lake in the world, is considered part of the Rift Valley system although it actually lies between the two branches. All of the African Great Lakes were formed as the result of the rift, and most lie within its rift valley.In Kenya, the valley is deepest to the north of Nairobi. As the lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind. For example, Lake Magadi has high concentrations of soda (sodium carbonate) and Lake Elmenteita, Lake Bogoria, and Lake Nakuru are all strongly alkaline, while the freshwater springs supplying Lake Naivasha are essential to support its current biological variety.Discoveries in human evolution.The Rift Valley in East Africa has been a rich source of fossilsthat allow study of human evolution, especially in an area known as Piedmont.Because the rapidly eroding highlands have filled the valley with sediments, a favorable environment for the preservation of remains has been created. The bones of several hominid ancestors of modern humans have been found there, including those of \"Lucy\", a partial, yet eye-opening australopithecine skeleton, which was discovered by anthropologist Donald Johanson dating back over 3 million years. Richard and Mary Leakey have also done significant work in this region.More recently, two other hominid ancestors have been discovered there: a 10 million year-old ape called \"Chororapithecus abyssinicus\", found in the Afar rift, in eastern Ethiopia, and the \"Nakalipithecus nakayamai\", which is also 10 million years old.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q138","QuestionID":"QID138"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID591","SecondaryAttribute":"Hackers can do some cool things at times.

Or how websites remember your preferences from visit-to-visit or device-to-device? The answer may be in the cookies&nbsp; or in other online tracking methods like device fingerprinting and cross-device tracking.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Here are answers to some commonly asked questions about online tracking&nbsp; how it works and how you can control it.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Understanding Cookies<\/p><p>&nbsp;What is a cookie?<\/p><p>&nbsp;A cookie is information saved by your web browser, the software program you use to visit the web. When you visit a website, the site might store a cookie so it can recognize your device in the future. Later if you return to that site, it can read that cookie to remember you from your last visit. By keeping track of you over time, cookies can be used to customize your browsing experience, or to deliver ads targeted to you.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Who places cookies on the web?<\/p><p>&nbsp;First-party cookies are placed by the site that you visit. They can make your experience on the web more efficient. For example, they help sites remember:<\/p><p>&nbsp;items in your shopping cart<\/p><p>&nbsp;your log-in name<\/p><p>&nbsp;your preferences, like always showing the weather in your home town<\/p><p>&nbsp;your high game scores.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Third-party cookies are placed by someone other than the site you are on. For example, the website may partner with an advertising network to deliver some of the ads you see. Or they may partner with an analytics company to help understand how people use their site. These third party companies also may place cookies in your browser to monitor your behavior over time.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Over time, these companies may develop a detailed history of the types of sites you frequent, and they may use this information to deliver ads tailored to your interests. For example, if an advertising company notices that you read a lot of articles about running, it may show you ads about running shoes&nbsp; even on an unrelated site youre visiting for the first time.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Understanding Other Online Tracking<\/p><p>&nbsp;What are Flash cookies?<\/p><p>&nbsp;A Flash cookie is a small file stored on your computer by a website that uses Adobes Flash player technology. Flash cookies use Adobes Flash player to store information about your online browsing activities. Flash cookies can be used to replace cookies used for tracking and advertising, because they also can store your settings and preferences. Similarly, companies can place unique HTML5 cookies within a browsers local storage to identify a user over time. When you delete or clear cookies from your browser, you will not necessarily delete the Flash cookies stored on your computer.<\/p><p>&nbsp;What is device fingerprinting?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Device fingerprinting can track devices over time, based on your browsers configurations and settings. Because each browser is unique, device fingerprinting can identify your device, without using cookies. Since device fingerprinting uses the characteristics of your browser configuration to track you, deleting cookies wont help.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Device fingerprinting technologies are evolving and can be used to track you on all kinds of internet-connected devices that have browsers, such as smart phones, tablets, laptop and desktop computers.<\/p><p>&nbsp;How does tracking in mobile apps occur?<\/p><p>&nbsp;When you access mobile applications, companies dont have access to traditional browser cookies to track you over time. Instead, third party advertising and analytics companies use device identifiers&nbsp; such as Apple iOSs Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA) and Google Androids Advertising ID&nbsp; to monitor the different applications used on a particular device.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Does tracking of other smart devices occur?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Yes. More and more, consumer devices, in addition to phones, are capable of being connected online. For example, smart entertainment systems often provide new ways for you to watch TV shows and movies, and also may use technology to monitor what you watch. Look to the settings on your devices to investigate whether you can reset identifiers on the devices or use web interfaces on another device to limit ad tracking.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Controlling Online Tracking<\/p><p>&nbsp;How can I control cookies?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Various browsers have different ways to let you delete cookies or limit the kinds of cookies that can be placed on your computer. When you choose a browser, consider which suits your privacy preferences best.<\/p><p>&nbsp;To check out the settings in a browser, use the Help tab or look under Tools for settings like Options or Privacy. From there, you may be able to delete cookies, or control when they can be placed. Some browsers allow add-on software tools to block, delete, or control cookies. And security software often includes options to make cookie control easier. If you delete cookies, companies may not be able to associate you with your past browsing activity. However, they may be able to track you in the future with a new cookie.<\/p><p>&nbsp;If you block cookies entirely, you may limit your browsing experience. For example, you may need to enter information repeatedly, or you might not get personalized content that is meaningful to you. Most browsers settings will allow you to block third-party cookies without also disabling first-party cookies.<\/p><p>&nbsp;How can I control Flash cookies and device fingerprinting?<\/p><p>&nbsp;The latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer let you control or delete Flash cookies through the browsers settings. If you use an older version of one of these browsers, upgrade to the most recent version, and set it to update automatically.<\/p><p>&nbsp;If you use a browser that doesnt let you delete Flash cookies, look at Adobes Website Storage Settings panel. There, you can view and delete Flash cookies, and control whether youll allow them on your computer.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Like regular cookies, deleting Flash cookies gets rid of the ones on your computer at that moment. Flash cookies can be placed on your computer the next time you visit a website or view an ad unless you block Flash cookies altogether.<\/p><p>&nbsp;How can I control tracking in or across mobile apps?<\/p><p>&nbsp;You can reset the identifiers on your device in the device settings. iOS users can do this by following Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Advertising &gt; Reset Advertising Identifier. For Android, the path is Google settings &gt; Ads &gt; Reset advertising ID. This control works much like deleting cookies in a browser&nbsp; the device is harder to associate with past activity, but tracking can start anew using the new advertising identifier.<\/p><p>&nbsp;You also can limit the use of identifiers for ad targeting on your devices. If you turn on this setting, apps are not permitted to use the advertising identifier to serve consumers targeted ads. For iOS, the controls are available through Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Advertising &gt; Limit Ad Tracking. For Android, Google Settings &gt; Ads &gt; Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads. Although this tool will limit the use of tracking data for targeting ads, companies may still be able to monitor your app usage for other purposes, such as research, measurement, and fraud prevention.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Mobile browsers work much like traditional web browsers, and the tracking technologies and user controls are much the same as for ordinary web browsers, described above.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Mobile applications also may collect your geolocation to share with advertising companies. The latest versions of iOS and Android allow you to limit which particular applications can access your location information.<\/p><p>&nbsp;What is private browsing?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Many browsers offer private browsing settings that are meant to let you keep your web activities hidden from other people who use the same computer. With private browsing turned on, your browser wont retain cookies, your browsing history, search records, or the files you downloaded. Privacy modes arent uniform, though; its a good idea to check your browser to see what types of data it stores.<\/p><p>&nbsp;But note that cookies used during the private browsing session still can communicate information about your browsing behavior to third parties. So, private browsing may not be effective in stopping third parties from using techniques such as fingerprinting to track your web activity.<\/p><p>&nbsp;What are opt-out cookies?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Some websites and advertising networks allow you to set cookies that tell them not to use information about what sites you visit to target ads to you. For example, the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) offer tools for opting out of targeted advertising&nbsp; often by placing opt-out cookies. If you delete all cookies, youll also delete the cookies that indicate your preference to opt out of targeted ads.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Cookies are used for many purposes&nbsp; for example, to limit the number of times youre shown a particular ad. So even if you opt out of targeted advertising, a company may still use cookies for other purposes.<\/p><p>&nbsp;What is Do Not Track?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Do Not Track is a setting in most internet browsers that allows you to express your preference not to be tracked across the web. Turning on Do Not Track through your web browser sends a signal to every website you visit that you dont want to be tracked from site to site. Companies then know your preference. If they have committed to respect your Do Not Track preference, they are legally required to do so. However, most tracking companies today have not committed to honoring users Do Not Track preferences.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Can I block online tracking?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Consumers can learn about tracker-blocking browser plugins which block the flow of information from a computer to tracking companies and allow consumers to block ads. They prevent companies from using cookies or fingerprinting to track your internet behavior.<\/p><p>&nbsp;To find tracker-blocking plugins, type tracker blocker in your search engine. Then, compare features to decide which tracker blocker is best for you. For example, some of them block tracking by default, while others require you to customize when youll block tracking.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Remember that websites that rely on third party tracking companies for measurement or advertising revenue may prevent you from using their site if you have blocking software installed. However, you can still open those sites in a separate browser that doesnt have blocking enabled, or you can disable blocking on those sites.&nbsp;<\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q549","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Have you ever wondered why some online ads you see are targeted to your tastes and interests?

This is often used as a justification for evaluating actions in terms of how much \"pleasure\" and how little \"pain\" (i.e. suffering) they produce. In very simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize this net pleasure (pleasure minus pain).Classic schools of antiquity.Democritus seems to be the earliest philosopher on record to have categorically embraced a hedonistic philosophy; he called the supreme goal of life \"contentment\" or \"cheerfulness\", claiming that \"joy and sorrow are the distinguishing mark of things beneficial and harmful\" (DK 68 B 188).The Cyrenaic school.The Cyrenaics were an ultra-hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BC, supposedly by Aristippus of Cyrene, although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name, Aristippus the Younger. The school was so called after Cyrene, the birthplace of Aristippus. It was one of the earliest Socratic schools. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain, but positively enjoyable sensations. Of these, momentary pleasures, especially physical ones, are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. They did, however, recognize the value of social obligation, and that pleasure could be gained from altruism. The school died out within a century, and was replaced by the more sophisticated philosophy of Epicureanism.Epicureanism.In the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure (tranquility and freedom from fear) was obtained by knowledge, friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life. He lauded the enjoyment of simple pleasures, by which he meant abstaining from bodily desires, such as sex and appetites, verging on asceticism. He argued that when eating, one should not eat too richly, for it could lead to dissatisfaction later, such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future. Likewise, sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner. Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social ethics that has survived.Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, though later it became the main opponent of Stoicism. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. After the death of Epicurus, his school was headed by Hermarchus; later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era (such as those in Antiochia, Alexandria, Rhodes and Ercolano). The poet Lucretius is its most known Roman proponent. By the end of the Roman Empire, having undergone Christian attack and repression, Epicureanism had all but died out, and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist Pierre Gassendi, who adapted it to the Christian doctrine.Some writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem On the Nature of Things by Lucretius to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean Philodemus.Christian.Christian hedonism is a controversial Christian doctrine current in some evangelical circles, particularly those of the Reformed tradition. The term was coined by Reformed Baptist pastor John Piper in his 1986 book \"Desiring God\". Piper summarizes this philosophy of the Christian life as \"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.\" Christian Hedonism may anachronistically describe the theology of Jonathan Edwards. In the 17th century the atomist Pierre Gassendi, adapted Epicureanism to the Christian doctrine.Mohism.Mohism was a philosophical school of thought founded by Mozi in the 5th century BCE. It paralleled the utilitarianism later developed by English thinkers. As Confucianism became the preferred philosophy of later Chinese dynasties, Mohism and other non-Confucian philosophical schools of thought were suppressed.Modern utilitarianism.Critics of the quantitative approach assert that, generally, \"pleasures\" do not necessarily share common traits besides the fact that they can be seen as \"pleasurable.\" Critics of the qualitative approach argue that whether one pleasure is higher than another depends on factors other than how pleasurable it is. For example, some people may see the pleasure of satanism as a more base pleasure because it is morally unpalatable to them, and not because it is lacking in pleasure.Egoism.Hedonism can be conjoined with psychological egoism - the theory that humans are motivated only by their self interest - to make psychological hedonism: a purely descriptive claim which states that agents naturally seek pleasure. Hedonism can also be combined with ethical egoism - the claim that individuals should seek their own good - to make ethical hedonism the claim that we \"should\" act so as to produce our own pleasure.However, hedonism is not necessarily related to egoism. The utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill is sometimes classified as a type of hedonism, as it judges the morality of actions by their consequent contributions to the greater good and happiness of all. This is altruistic hedonism. Whereas some hedonistic doctrines propose doing whatever makes an individual happiest (over the long run), Mill promotes actions which make \"everyone\" happy. Compare individualism and collectivism.It is true that Epicurus recommends for us to pursue our own pleasure, but he never suggests we should live a selfish life which impedes others from getting to that same objective.Some of Sigmund Freud's theories of human motivation have been called psychological hedonism; his \"life instinct\" is essentially the observation that people will pursue pleasure. However, he introduces extra complexities with various other mechanisms, such as the \"death instinct\". The death instinct, Thanatos, can be equated to the desire for silence and peace, for calm and darkness, which causes them another form of happiness. It is also a death instinct, thus it can also be the desire for death. Psychoanalysis has developed greatly since Freud but his ideas remain influential and contentious.Contemporary approaches.Michel Onfray.A dedicated contemporary hedonist philosopher and on the history of hedonistic thought is the French Michel Onfray. He defines hedonism \"as an introspective attitude to life based on taking pleasure yourself and pleasuring others, without harming yourself or anyone else.\" \"Onfray's philosophical project is to define an ethical hedonism, a joyous utilitarianism, and a generalized aesthetic of sensual materialism that explores how to use the brain's and the body's capacities to their fullest extent -- while restoring philosophy to a useful role in art, politics, and everyday life and decisions.\"For this he has \"written books on each of these facets of the same world view.\"His philosophy aims \"for \"micro-revolutions, \" or revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic, libertarian values.\"Abolitionism.One modern group that is hedonistic is the Abolitionist Society. They are also a part of the transhumanistic movement. They propose that all suffering should be abolished, and the prospects for happiness be increased, through biotechnology at a major scale.Criticism.Hedonism has been criticized by a number of modern philosophers.Robert Nozick argued that we do not only want the pleasure from our activities, but actually want to do them for their own sake as well.G.E. Moore argued that hedonists commit the naturalistic fallacy.To take \"whatever makes one happy\" as a guide to action means: to be guided by nothing but one's emotional whims. Emotions are not tools of cognition.... \"This\" is the fallacy inherent in \"hedonism\"--in any variant of ethical hedonism, personal or social, individual or collective. \"Happiness\" can properly be the \"purpose\" of ethics, but \"not\" the \"standard\". The task of ethics is to define man's proper code of values and thus to give him the means of achieving happiness. To declare, as the ethical hedonists do, that \"the proper value is whatever gives you pleasure\" is to declare that \"the proper value is whatever you happen to value\"--which is an act of intellectual and philosophical abdication, an act which merely proclaims the futility of ethics and invites all men to play it deuces wild.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Hedonism.Hedonism is a school of ethics which argues that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.Ety...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div><div><div><div><div><div>List of historical drama films.The historical drama is a film genre in which stories are based upon historical events and famous persons.

Red blood cells contain hemoglobin\u2014an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color and carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. \nWhen the kidneys and glomeruli\u2014the tiny units within the kidneys where blood is filtered\u2014become clogged with the damaged red blood cells, they are unable to do their jobs. If the kidneys stop functioning, a child can develop acute kidney injury\u2014 the sudden and temporary loss of kidney function. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is the most common cause of acute kidney injury in children. \n\nWhat are the kidneys and what do they do? \nThe kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adults and the amount produced depends on their age. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. \nUrinary tract inside the outline of the upper half of a child\u2019s human body\nThe kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. \n\n\nWhat causes hemolytic uremic syndrome in children? \nThe most common cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children is an Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection of the digestive system. The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract\u2014a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus\u2014and other organs that help the body break down and absorb food. \nNormally, harmless strains, or types, of E. coli are found in the intestines and are an important part of digestion. However, if a child becomes infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli, the bacteria will lodge in the digestive tract and produce toxins that can enter the bloodstream. The toxins travel through the bloodstream and can destroy the red blood cells. \nE.coli O157:H7 can be found in\n.\nundercooked meat, most often ground beef\n\n.\nunpasteurized, or raw, milk\n\n.\nunwashed, contaminated raw fruits and vegetables\n\n.\ncontaminated juice\n\n.\ncontaminated swimming pools or lakes\n\n\nLess common causes, sometimes called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, can include \n.\ntaking certain medications, such as chemotherapy\n\n.\nhaving other viral or bacterial infections\n\n.\ninheriting a certain type of hemolytic uremicsyndrome that runs in families\n\n\nRead more about foodborne illnesses and the digestive system at www.digestive.niddk.nih.gov. \n\nWhich children are more likely to develop hemolytic uremic syndrome? \nChildren who are more likely to develop hemolytic uremic syndrome include those who \n.\nare younger than age 5 and have been diagnosedwith an E. coli O157:H7 infection\n\n.\nhave a weakened immune system\n\n.\nhave a family history of inherited hemolyticuremic syndrome\n\n\nHemolytic uremic syndrome occurs in about two out of every 100,000 children. \n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children? \nA child with hemolytic uremic syndrome may develop signs and symptoms similar to those seen with gastroenteritis\u2014an inflammation of the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine\u2014 such as \n.\nvomiting\n\n.\nbloody diarrhea\n\n.\nabdominal pain\n\n.\nfever and chills\n\n.\nheadache\n\n\nAs the infection progresses, the toxins released in the intestine begin to destroy red blood cells. When the red blood cells are destroyed, the child may experience the signs and symptoms of anemia\u2014a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the body\u2019s cells from getting enough oxygen. \nSigns and symptoms of anemia may include \n.\nfatigue, or feeling tired\n\n.\nweakness\n\n.\nfainting\n\n.\npaleness\n\n\nAs the damaged red blood cells clog the glomeruli, the kidneys may become damaged and make less urine. When damaged, the kidneys work harder to remove wastes and extra fluid from the blood, sometimes leading to acute kidney injury. \nOther signs and symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome may include bruising and seizures. \nWhen hemolytic uremic syndrome causes acute kidney injury, a child may have the following signs and symptoms: \n..\t \nedema\u2014swelling, most often in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face \n\n..\t \nalbuminuria\u2014when a child\u2019s urine has high levels of albumin, the main protein in the blood \n\n..\t \ndecreased urine output \n\n..\t \nhypoalbuminemia\u2014when a child\u2019s blood has low levels of albumin \n\n..\t \nblood in the urine \n\n\n\nSeek Immediate Care \nParents or caretakers should seek immediate care for a child experiencing any urgent symptoms, such as \n.. \nunusual bleeding \n\n.. \nswelling \n\n.. \nextreme fatigue \n\n.. \ndecreased urine output \n\n.. \nunexplained bruises \n\n\n\nHow is hemolytic uremic syndrome in children diagnosed? \nA health care provider diagnoses hemolytic uremic syndrome with \n..\n a medical and family history \n\n..\n a physical exam \n\n.. \nurine tests \n\n..\n a blood test \n\n.. \na stool test \n\n.. \nkidney biopsy \n\n\nMedical and Family History \nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose hemolytic uremic syndrome. \n\nPhysical Exam \nA physical exam may help diagnose hemolytic uremic syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider most often \n..\t \nexamines a child\u2019s body \n\n..\t \ntaps on specific areas of the child\u2019s body \n\n\n\nUrine Tests \nA health care provider may order the following urine tests to help determine if a child has kidney damage from hemolytic uremic syndrome. \nDipstick test for albumin. A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine, which could mean kidney damage. The child or caretaker collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care provider\u2019s office or a commercial facility. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the child\u2019s urine sample. Patches on the dipstick change color when albumin is present in the urine. \nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses this measurement to estimate the amount of albumin passed into the urine over a 24-hour period. The child provides a urine sample during an appointment with the health care provider. Creatinine is a waste product that is filtered in the kidneys and passed in the urine. A high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio indicates that the kidneys are leaking large amounts of albumin into the urine. \n\nBlood Test \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider\u2019s office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider will test the blood sample to \n..\nestimate how much blood the kidneys filter eachminute, called the estimated glomerular filtrationrate, or eGFR. The test results help the healthcare provider determine the amount of kidneydamage from hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\n..\ncheck red blood cell and platelet levels.\n\n..\ncheck for liver and kidney function.\n\n..\nassess protein levels in the blood.\n\n\n\nStool Test \nA stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the child\u2019s parent or caretaker a container for catching and storing the stool. The parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Stool tests can show the presence of E. coli O157:H7. \n\nKidney Biopsy \nBiopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The health care provider will give the child light sedation and local anesthetic; however, in some cases, the child will require general anesthesia. A pathologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases\u2014examines the tissue in a lab. The pathologist looks for signs of kidney disease and infection. The test can help diagnose hemolytic uremic syndrome. \n\n\nWhat are the complications of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children? \nMost children who develop hemolytic uremic syndrome and its complications recover without permanent damage to their health.1 \nHowever, children with hemolytic uremic syndrome may have serious and sometimes life-threatening complications, including \n..\nacute kidney injury\n\n..\nhigh blood pressure\n\n..\nblood-clotting problems that can lead to bleeding\n\n..\nseizures\n\n..\nheart problems\n\n..\nchronic, or long lasting, kidney disease\n\n..\nstroke\n\n..\ncoma\n\n\n\nHow is hemolytic uremic syndrome in children treated? \nA health care provider will treat a child with hemolytic uremic syndrome by addressing \n..\nurgent symptoms and preventing complications\n\n..\nacute kidney injury\n\n..\nchronic kidney disease (CKD)\n\n\nIn most cases, health care providers do not treat children with hemolytic uremic syndrome with antibiotics unless they have infections in other areas of the body. With proper management, most children recover without long-term health problems.2 \n1Basic information about E. coli O157:H7 in drinking water.

Treating Urgent Symptoms and Preventing Complications \nA health care provider will treat a child\u2019s urgent symptoms and try to prevent complications by \n..\t\n observing the child closely in the hospital \n\n..\t \nreplacing minerals, such as potassium and salt, and fluids through an intravenous (IV) tube \n\n..\t \ngiving the child red blood cells and platelets\u2014 cells in the blood that help with clotting\u2014through an IV \n\n..\t \ngiving the child IV nutrition \n\n..\t \ntreating high blood pressure with medications \n\n\n\nTreating Acute Kidney Injury \nIf necessary, a health care provider will treat acute kidney injury with dialysis\u2014the process of filtering wastes and extra fluid from the body with an artificial kidney. The two forms of dialysis are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Most children with acute kidney injury need dialysis for a short time only. Read more about dialysis at www.kidney.niddk.nih.gov. \n\nTreating Chronic Kidney Disease \nSome children may sustain significant kidney damage that slowly develops into CKD. Children who develop CKD must receive treatment to replace the work the kidneys do. The two types of treatment are dialysis and transplantation. \nIn most cases, health care providers treat CKD with a kidney transplant. A kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from someone who has just died or a living donor, most often a family member, into a person\u2019s body to take over the job of the failing kidney. Though some children receive a kidney transplant before their kidneys fail completely, many children begin with dialysis to stay healthy until they can have a transplant. \nRead more in Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure in Children at www.kidney.niddk.nih.gov. \n\n\nHow can hemolytic uremic syndrome in children be prevented? \nParents and caregivers can help prevent childhood hemolytic uremic syndrome due to E. coli O157:H7 by \n..\t \navoiding unclean swimming areas \n\n..\t \navoiding unpasteurized milk, juice, and cider \n\n..\t \ncleaning utensils and food surfaces often \n\n..\t \ncooking meat to an internal temperature of at least 160\u00b0 F \n\n..\t \ndefrosting meat in the microwave or refrigerator \n\n..\t\n keeping children out of pools if they have had diarrhea \n\n..\t\n keeping raw foods separate \n\n..\t \nwashing hands before eating \n\n..\t \nwashing hands well after using the restroom and after changing diapers \n\n\nWhen a child is taking medications that may cause hemolytic uremic syndrome, it is important that the parent or caretaker watch for symptoms and report any changes in the child\u2019s condition to the health care provider as soon as possible. \n\nEating, Diet, and Nutrition \nAt the beginning of the illness, children with hemolytic uremic syndrome may need IV nutrition or supplements to help maintain fluid balance in the body. Some children may need to follow a low-salt diet to help prevent swelling and high blood pressure. \nHealth care providers will encourage children with hemolytic uremic syndrome to eat when they are hungry. Most children who completely recover and do not have permanent kidney damage can return to their usual diet. \n\nPoints to Remember \n..\t \nHemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, is a kidney condition that happens when red blood cells are destroyed and block the kidneys\u2019 filtering system. \n\n..\t\n The most common cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children is an Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection of the digestive system. \n\n..\t \nNormally, harmless strains, or types, of E. coli are found in the intestines and are an important part of digestion. However, if a child becomes infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli, the bacteria will lodge in the digestive tract and produce toxins that can enter the bloodstream. \n\n..\t \nA child with hemolytic uremic syndrome may develop signs and symptoms similar to those seen with gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. \n\n..\t \nMost children who develop hemolytic uremic syndrome and its complications recover without permanent damage to their health. \n\n..\t \nSome children may sustain significant kidney damage that slowly develops into chronic kidney disease (CKD). \n\n..\t \nParents and caregivers can help prevent childhood hemolytic uremic syndrome due to E. coli O157:H7 by \n\n\u2013\t \navoiding unclean swimming areas \n\n\u2013\t \navoiding unpasteurized milk, juice, and cider \n\n\u2013\t \ncleaning utensils and food surfaces often \n\n\u2013\t \ncooking meat to an internal temperature of at least 160\u00b0 F \n\n\u2013\t \ndefrosting meat in the microwave or \nrefrigerator\n \n\n\u2013\t \nkeeping children out of pools if they have had diarrhea \n\n\u2013\t \nkeeping raw foods separate \n\n\u2013\t \nwashing hands before eating \n\n\u2013\t \nwashing hands well after using the restroom and after changing diapers <\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q494","QuestionID":"QID494","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome in Children Logo of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men in the United States, killing 307,225 men in 2009\u2014that\u2019s 1 in \nevery 4 male deaths.1 \n. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men of most racial\/ethnic groups in the United States, including \nAfrican Americans, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Hispanics, and whites. For Asian American or Pacific \nIslander men, heart disease is second only to cancer.2 \n. About 8.5% of all white men, 7.9% of black men, and 6.3% of Mexican American men have coronary heart \ndisease.3 \n. Half of the men who die suddenly of coronary heart disease have no previous symptoms.3 Even if you have no \nsymptoms, you may still be at risk for heart disease. \n. Between 70% and 89% of sudden cardiac events occur in men.3 \n\n\n\f\nRisk Factors \n\nHigh blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of Americans \n(49%) have at least one of these three risk factors.4 \n\nSeveral other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including: \n\n. Diabetes \n. Overweight and obesity \n. Poor diet \n. Physical inactivity \n. Excessive alcohol use \n\n\nCDC\u2019s Public Health Efforts \n\n.

The New York Times Bits Blogs details how a 6-year-old virus called Zeus is all over Facebook right now. Heres how to avoid it.<\/div><div>&nbsp;After a malicious link is clicked, Zeus will remain inactive on your computer until someone logs into a bank account, swiping usernames and passwords so hackers can access it. A security firm called Trend Micro has found Zeus-laden links with increasingly frequency on Facebook, including on one football fan pages.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Of course, there is no fool-proof way to avoid viruses like this one. But there are three ways to avoid becoming the victim of this particular one:<\/div><div>&nbsp;1. Avoid Windows computers if possible.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Business Insiders Kevin Smith notes that Zeus targets machines running on Windows, and does not work on Mac OS X or Linux. Its usually not feasible to switch operating systems, but its one way of avoiding the virus. However, variants of Zeus that can infect Android and Blackberry smartphones have been found, so it is possible that a modified version of the virus is at work here as well.<\/div><div>&nbsp;2. Dont click on unknown links.<\/div><div>&nbsp;This is Virus Avoidance 101, but its still important to reiterate. Many people dont realize that all it takes is clicking on a bad link to infect their computer with malware. Rule of thumb: If you dont know the links sender or the link looks strange at all, do not click. Its not worth the risk.<\/div><div>&nbsp;3. Make sure your bank has 2-step verification.<\/div><div>&nbsp;The more secure your banks website is, the safer your money is.

It seems worth noting that the periods of medieval German literature span two or three centuries, those of early modern German literature span one century, and those of modern German literature each span one or two decades. The closer one nears the present, the more debated the periodizations become.graph of works listed in Frenzel, \"Daten deutscher Dichtung\" (1952). Visible is medieval literature overlapping with Renaissance up to the 1540s, modern literature beginning 1720, and the baroque period separating the two, from 1550 to 1700.Middle Ages.Medieval German literature refers to literature written in Germany, stretching from the Carolingian dynasty; various dates have been given for the end of the German literary Middle Ages, the Reformation (1517) being the last possible cut-off point.Old High German.The Old High German period is reckoned to run until about the mid-11th century, though the boundary to Early Middle High German (second half of the 11th century) is not clear-cut.The most famous work in OHG is the \"Hildebrandslied\", a short piece of Germanic alliterative heroic verse which besides the \"Muspilli\" is the sole survivor of what must have been a vast oral tradition. Another important work, in the northern dialect of Old Saxon, is a life of Christ in the style of a heroic epic known as the \"Heliand\".Middle High German.Baroque period.Sensibility.\"Sturm und Drang\".\"Sturm und Drang\" (the conventional translation is \"Storm and Stress\"; a more literal translation, however, might be \"storm and urge\", \"storm and longing\", or \"storm and impulse\") is the name of a movement in German literature and music taking place from the late 1760s through the early 1780s in which individual subjectivity and, in particular, extremes of emotion were given free expression in response to the confines of rationalism imposed by the Enlightenment and associated aesthetic movements. The philosopher Johann Georg Hamann is considered to be the ideologue of Sturm und Drang, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was a notable proponent of the movement, though he and Friedrich Schiller ended their period of association with it, initiating what would become Weimar Classicism.German Classicism.Romanticism.German Romanticism was the dominant movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. German Romanticism developed relatively late compared to its English counterpart, coinciding in its early years with the movement known as German Classicism or Weimar Classicism, which it opposed. In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety is notable for valuing humor and wit as well as beauty. The early German romantics tried to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, looking to the Middle Ages as a simpler, more integrated period. As time went on, however, they became increasingly aware of the tenuousness of the unity they were seeking. Later German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the everyday world and the seemingly irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius. Heinrich Heine in particular criticized the tendency of the early romantics to look to the medieval past for a model of unity in art and society.Nazi Germany.Under the Nazi regime, some authors went into exile (\"Exilliteratur\") and others submitted to censorship (\"internal emigration\", \"Innere Emigration\")Nobel Prize laureates.The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to German language authors thirteen times (as of 2009), or the third most often after English and French language authors (with 27 and 14 laureates, respectively).<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q18","QuestionID":"QID18"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID563","SecondaryAttribute":"In digital identity guidelines laid down by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, w...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-dca70e71-1a05-d448-646d-2999e9ac61c8\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In digital identity guidelines laid down by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, what do they recommend should the length of passwords at least be?<\/span><\/span>","DataExportTag":"Q563","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"In digital identity guidelines laid down by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, w...","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"sixteen characters in length"},"2":{"Display":"eight characters in length"},"3":{"Display":"six digits in length"},"4":{"Display":"eighteen characters in length"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3,4],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID563"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID198","SecondaryAttribute":"In what role was John Walker serving when he was captured as an enemy?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e031180-fb0c-aa4b-c3ca-8fdf19710bff\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In what role was John Walker serving when he was captured as an enemy? <\/span><\/span>","DataExportTag":"Q198","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"In what role was John Walker serving when he was captured as an enemy?","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Pilot"},"2":{"Display":"Spy"},"3":{"Display":"Combatant"},"4":{"Display":"Driver"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3,4],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID198","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID21","SecondaryAttribute":"In what year did Leopold I take control of Melk?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"In what year did Leopold I take control of Melk?","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"In what year did Leopold I take control of Melk?","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"975"},"2":{"Display":"983"},"3":{"Display":"985"},"4":{"Display":"991"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3,4],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"QuestionText_Unsafe":"Which of the following are examples of Old High German literature?

The epidemiology of AIDS or global warming require understanding of diverse disciplines to solve neglected problems. \"Interdisciplinary\" may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions, for example, women's studies or ethnic area studies.The adjective interdisciplinary is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand, including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines. For example, the subject of land use may appear differently when examined by different disciplines, for instance, biology, chemistry, economics, geography, and politics.Development.Interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise from a shared conviction that the traditional disciplines are unable or unwilling to address an important problem. For example, social science disciplines such as anthropology and sociology paid little attention to the social analysis of technology throughout most of the twentieth century. As a result, many social scientists with interests in technology have joined science and technology studies programs, which are typically staffed by scholars drawn from numerous disciplines. They may also arise from new research developments, such as nanotechnology, which cannot be addressed without combining the approaches of two or more disciplines. Examples include quantum information processing, an amalgamation of quantum physics and computer science, and bioinformatics, combining molecular biology with computer science. Some institutions of higher education offer accredited degree programs in Interdisciplinary Studies. Norfolk State University, a historically black institution located in Norfolk, VA, is one such example of this.Barriers.Because most participants in interdisciplinary ventures were trained in traditional disciplines, they must learn to appreciate differing perspectives and methods. For example, a discipline that places more emphasis on quantitative \"rigor\" may produce practitioners who think of themselves (and their discipline) as \"more scientific\" than others; in turn, colleagues in \"softer\" disciplines may associate quantitative approaches with an inability to grasp the broader dimensions of a problem. An interdisciplinary program may not succeed if its members remain stuck in their disciplines (and in disciplinary attitudes).From the disciplinary perspective, much interdisciplinary work may be seen as \"soft,\" lacking in rigor, or ideologically motivated; these beliefs place barriers in the career paths of those who choose interdisciplinary work. For example, interdisciplinary grant applications are often refereed by peer reviewers drawn from established disciplines; not surprisingly, interdisciplinary researchers may experience difficulty getting funding for their research. In addition, untenured researchers know that, when they seek promotion and tenure, it is likely that some of the evaluators will lack commitment to interdisciplinarity. They may fear that making a commitment to interdisciplinary research will increase the risk of being denied tenure.Interdisciplinary programs may fail if they are not given sufficient autonomy. For example, interdisciplinary faculty are usually recruited to a joint appointment, with responsibilities in both an interdisciplinary program (such as women's studies) and a traditional discipline (such as history). If the traditional discipline makes the tenure decisions, new interdisciplinary faculty will be hesitant to commit themselves fully to interdisciplinary work. Other barriers include the generally disciplinary orientation of most scholarly journals, leading to the perception, if not the fact, that interdisciplinary research is hard to publish. In addition, since traditional budgetary practices at most universities channel resources through the disciplines, it becomes difficult to account for a given scholar or teacher's salary and time. During periods of budgetary retraction, the natural tendency to serve the primary constituency (i.e., students majoring in the traditional discipline) makes resources scarce for teaching and research comparatively far from the center of the discipline as traditionally understood. For these same reasons, the introduction of new interdisciplinary programs is often perceived as a competition for diminishing funds, and may for this reason meet resistance.Due to these and other barriers, interdisciplinary research areas are strongly motivated to become disciplines themselves. If they succeed, they can establish their own research funding programs and make their own tenure and promotion decisions. In so doing, they lower the risk of entry. Examples of former interdisciplinary research areas that have become disciplines include neuroscience, cybernetics, biochemistry and biomedical engineering. These new fields are occasionally referred to as \"interdisciplines.\"Interdisciplinary studies.\"Interdisciplinary studies\" is an academic program or process seeking to synthesize broad perspectives, knowledge, skills, interconnections, and epistemology in an educational setting. Interdisciplinary programs may be founded in order to facilitate the study of subjects which have some coherence, but which cannot be adequately understood from a single disciplinary perspective (for example, women's studies or medieval studies). More rarely, and at a more advanced level, interdisciplinarity may itself become the focus of study, in a critique of institutionalized disciplines' ways of segmenting knowledge.Since 1998 there has been an ascendancy in the value of the concept and practice of interdisciplinary research and teaching and a growth in the number of bachelors degrees awarded at U.S. universities classified as multi- or interdisciplinary studies. The number of interdisciplinary bachelors degrees awarded annually rose from 7,000 in 1973 to 30,000 a year by 2005 according to data from the National Center of Educational Statistics (NECS). In addition, educational leaders from the Boyer Commission to Carnegie's President Vartan Gregorian to Alan Leshner, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science have advocated for interdisciplinary rather than disciplinary approaches to problem solving in the 21st Century. This has been echoed by federal funding agencies, particularly the NIH under the Direction of Elias Zerhouni, who have advocated that grant proposals be framed more as interdisciplinary collaborative projects than single researcher, single discipline ones. At the same time, longstanding bachelors in interdisciplinary studies programs many existing and thriving for 30 or more years, have been closed down, in spite of healthy enrollment. Examples include Arizona International (formerly part of the University of Arizona), The School of Interdisciplinary Studies at Miami University, and the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at Wayne State University; others such as the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at Appalachian State University, and George Mason University's New Century College, have been cut back. Stuart Henry has seen this trend as part of the hegemony of the disciplines in their attempt to recolonize the experimental knowledge production of otherwise marginalized fields of inquiry. This is due to threat perceptions seemingly based on the ascendancy of interdisciplinary studies against traditional academia.Historical examples.There are many examples of when a particular idea, almost on the same period, arises in different disciplines. One case is the shift from the approach of focusing on \"specialized segments of attention\" (adopting one particular perspective), to the idea of \"instant sensory awareness of the whole\", an attention to the \"total field\", a \"sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity\", an \"integral idea of structure and configuration\". This has happened in painting (with cubism), physics, poetry, communication and educational theory. According to Marshall McLuhan, this paradigm shift was due to the passage from an era shaped by mechanization, which brought sequentiality, to the era shaped by the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Interdisciplinarity.An interdisciplinary field is a field of study that crosses traditional bound...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Hedonism.Hedonism is a school of ethics which argues that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.Etymology.Basic concepts.The basic idea behind hedonistic thought is that pleasure is the only thing that has intrinsic value. This is often used as a justification for evaluating actions in terms of how much \"pleasure\" and how little \"pain\" (i.e. suffering) they produce. In very simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize this net pleasure (pleasure minus pain).Classic schools of antiquity.Democritus seems to be the earliest philosopher on record to have categorically embraced a hedonistic philosophy; he called the supreme goal of life \"contentment\" or \"cheerfulness\", claiming that \"joy and sorrow are the distinguishing mark of things beneficial and harmful\" (DK 68 B 188).The Cyrenaic school.The Cyrenaics were an ultra-hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BC, supposedly by Aristippus of Cyrene, although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name, Aristippus the Younger. The school was so called after Cyrene, the birthplace of Aristippus. It was one of the earliest Socratic schools. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain, but positively enjoyable sensations. Of these, momentary pleasures, especially physical ones, are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. They did, however, recognize the value of social obligation, and that pleasure could be gained from altruism. The school died out within a century, and was replaced by the more sophisticated philosophy of Epicureanism.Epicureanism.In the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure (tranquility and freedom from fear) was obtained by knowledge, friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life. He lauded the enjoyment of simple pleasures, by which he meant abstaining from bodily desires, such as sex and appetites, verging on asceticism. He argued that when eating, one should not eat too richly, for it could lead to dissatisfaction later, such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future. Likewise, sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner. Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social ethics that has survived.Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, though later it became the main opponent of Stoicism. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. After the death of Epicurus, his school was headed by Hermarchus; later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era (such as those in Antiochia, Alexandria, Rhodes and Ercolano). The poet Lucretius is its most known Roman proponent. By the end of the Roman Empire, having undergone Christian attack and repression, Epicureanism had all but died out, and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist Pierre Gassendi, who adapted it to the Christian doctrine.Some writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem On the Nature of Things by Lucretius to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean Philodemus.Christian.Christian hedonism is a controversial Christian doctrine current in some evangelical circles, particularly those of the Reformed tradition. The term was coined by Reformed Baptist pastor John Piper in his 1986 book \"Desiring God\". Piper summarizes this philosophy of the Christian life as \"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.\" Christian Hedonism may anachronistically describe the theology of Jonathan Edwards. In the 17th century the atomist Pierre Gassendi, adapted Epicureanism to the Christian doctrine.Mohism.Mohism was a philosophical school of thought founded by Mozi in the 5th century BCE. It paralleled the utilitarianism later developed by English thinkers. As Confucianism became the preferred philosophy of later Chinese dynasties, Mohism and other non-Confucian philosophical schools of thought were suppressed.Modern utilitarianism.Critics of the quantitative approach assert that, generally, \"pleasures\" do not necessarily share common traits besides the fact that they can be seen as \"pleasurable.\" Critics of the qualitative approach argue that whether one pleasure is higher than another depends on factors other than how pleasurable it is. For example, some people may see the pleasure of satanism as a more base pleasure because it is morally unpalatable to them, and not because it is lacking in pleasure.Egoism.Hedonism can be conjoined with psychological egoism - the theory that humans are motivated only by their self interest - to make psychological hedonism: a purely descriptive claim which states that agents naturally seek pleasure. Hedonism can also be combined with ethical egoism - the claim that individuals should seek their own good - to make ethical hedonism the claim that we \"should\" act so as to produce our own pleasure.However, hedonism is not necessarily related to egoism. The utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill is sometimes classified as a type of hedonism, as it judges the morality of actions by their consequent contributions to the greater good and happiness of all. This is altruistic hedonism. Whereas some hedonistic doctrines propose doing whatever makes an individual happiest (over the long run), Mill promotes actions which make \"everyone\" happy. Compare individualism and collectivism.It is true that Epicurus recommends for us to pursue our own pleasure, but he never suggests we should live a selfish life which impedes others from getting to that same objective.Some of Sigmund Freud's theories of human motivation have been called psychological hedonism; his \"life instinct\" is essentially the observation that people will pursue pleasure. However, he introduces extra complexities with various other mechanisms, such as the \"death instinct\". The death instinct, Thanatos, can be equated to the desire for silence and peace, for calm and darkness, which causes them another form of happiness. It is also a death instinct, thus it can also be the desire for death. Psychoanalysis has developed greatly since Freud but his ideas remain influential and contentious.Contemporary approaches.Michel Onfray.A dedicated contemporary hedonist philosopher and on the history of hedonistic thought is the French Michel Onfray. He defines hedonism \"as an introspective attitude to life based on taking pleasure yourself and pleasuring others, without harming yourself or anyone else.\" \"Onfray's philosophical project is to define an ethical hedonism, a joyous utilitarianism, and a generalized aesthetic of sensual materialism that explores how to use the brain's and the body's capacities to their fullest extent -- while restoring philosophy to a useful role in art, politics, and everyday life and decisions.\"For this he has \"written books on each of these facets of the same world view.\"His philosophy aims \"for \"micro-revolutions, \" or revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic, libertarian values.\"Abolitionism.One modern group that is hedonistic is the Abolitionist Society. They are also a part of the transhumanistic movement. They propose that all suffering should be abolished, and the prospects for happiness be increased, through biotechnology at a major scale.Criticism.Hedonism has been criticized by a number of modern philosophers.Robert Nozick argued that we do not only want the pleasure from our activities, but actually want to do them for their own sake as well.G.E. Moore argued that hedonists commit the naturalistic fallacy.To take \"whatever makes one happy\" as a guide to action means: to be guided by nothing but one's emotional whims. Emotions are not tools of cognition.... \"This\" is the fallacy inherent in \"hedonism\"--in any variant of ethical hedonism, personal or social, individual or collective. \"Happiness\" can properly be the \"purpose\" of ethics, but \"not\" the \"standard\". The task of ethics is to define man's proper code of values and thus to give him the means of achieving happiness. To declare, as the ethical hedonists do, that \"the proper value is whatever gives you pleasure\" is to declare that \"the proper value is whatever you happen to value\"--which is an act of intellectual and philosophical abdication, an act which merely proclaims the futility of ethics and invites all men to play it deuces wild.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q150","QuestionID":"QID150"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID237","SecondaryAttribute":"Interstitial cystitis.Interstitial cystitis or Bladder pain syndrome\/interstitial cystitis (commo...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Interstitial cystitis.Interstitial cystitis or Bladder pain syndrome\/interstitial cystitis (commonly abbreviated to \"BPS\/IC\") is a urinary bladder disease of unknown cause characterised by pain associated with urination (dysuria), urinary frequency (as often as every 10 minutes), urgency, and pressure in the bladder and\/or pelvis. Pain that worsened with a certain food or drink and\/or worsened with bladder filling and\/or improved with urination was reported by 97% of patients. Patients may also experience nocturia, pelvic floor dysfunction and tension (thus making it difficult to start their urine stream), pain with sexual intercourse, and discomfort and difficulty driving, traveling or working. Research has claimed that the quality of life of some IC patients is equivalent to those with end stage renal failure.It is not unusual for patients to have been misdiagnosed with a variety of other conditions, including: overactive bladder, urethritis, urethral syndrome, trigonitis, prostatitis and other generic terms used to describe frequency\/urgency symptoms in the urinary tract.BPS\/IC affects men and women of all cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, and ages. Although the disease previously was believed to be a condition of menopausal women, growing numbers of men and women are being diagnosed in their twenties and younger. BPS\/IC is not a rare condition, however BPS\/IC is more common in females than in men. Early research suggested that BPS\/IC prevalence ranged from 1 in 100,000 to 5.1 in 1,000 of the general population. Up to 12% of women may have early symptoms of BPS\/IC.Nomenclature.Originally called \"interstitial cystitis\", the name for this disorder changed to \"Bladder pain syndrome\/interstitial cystitis\" in the period 2002-2010. In 2007, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) began using the umbrella term Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes (UCPPS) to refer to pain syndromes associated with the bladder (i.e. Bladder pain syndrome\/interstitial cystitis, BPS\/IC) and the prostate gland (i.e. CPPS).In 2008, terms currently in use in addition to BPS\/IC include \"painful bladder syndrome\", \"bladder pain syndrome\" and \"hypersensitive bladder syndrome\", alone and in a variety of combinations. These different terms are being used in different parts of the world.The term \"interstitial cystitis\" is the primary term used in ICD-10 and MeSH.Causes.The cause of BPS\/IC is unknown, though several theories have been put forward (these include autoimmune, neurologic, allergic and genetic). Regardless of the origin, it is clear that the majority of BPS\/IC patients struggle with a damaged urothelium, or bladder lining. When the surface glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer is damaged (via a urinary tract infection (UTI), excessive consumption of coffee or sodas, traumatic injury, etc.), urinary chemicals can \"leak\" into surrounding tissues, causing pain, inflammation, and urinary symptoms. Oral medications like Elmiron and medications that are placed directly into the bladder via a catheter work to repair and rebuild this damaged\/wounded lining, allowing for a reduction in symptoms.Recent work at the University of Maryland, Baltimore indicates that genetics may be a factor in a small subset of patients. Two genes, FZD8 and PAND, are associated with the syndrome.Symptoms.The symptoms of BPS\/IC are often misdiagnosed as a \"common\" bladder infection (cystitis) or a UTI. However BPS\/IC has not been shown to be caused by a bacterial infection, and the mis-prescribed treatment of antibiotics is ineffective. The symptoms of BPS\/IC may also initially be attributed to prostatitis and epididymitis (in men) and endometriosis and uterine fibroids (in women).The most common symptom of BPS\/IC is pain, which is found in 100% of patients, frequency (82% of patients) and nocturia (62%).During cystoscopy, 5 to 10% of patients are found to have Hunner's ulcers. Far more patients may experience a very mild form of BPS\/IC, in which they have no visible wounds in their bladder, yet struggle with symptoms of pain, frequency and\/or urgency. Still other patients may have discomfort only in their urethra, while others struggle with pain in the entire pelvis.Diagnosis.Diagnosis has been greatly simplified in recent years with the development of two new methodologies. The \"Pelvic Pain Urgency\/Frequency (PUF) Patient Survey\", created by C. Lowell Parsons, is a short questionnaire that will help doctors identify if pelvic pain could be coming from the bladder. The \"KCl test\", also known as the \"potassium sensitivity test\", uses a mild potassium solution to test the integrity of the bladder wall. Though the latter is not specific for BPS\/IC, it has been determined to be helpful in predicting the use of compounds, such as pentosan polysulphate, which are designed to help repair the GAG layer. The previous gold standard test for BPS\/IC was the use of hydrodistention with cystoscopy. Researchers, however, determined that this visual examination of the bladder wall after stretching the bladder was not specific for BPS\/IC and that the test, itself, can contribute to the development of small glomerulations (that is, petechial hemorrhages) often found in BPS\/IC. Thus, a diagnosis of BPS\/IC is one of exclusion, as well as a review of clinical symptoms.In 2006, the ESSIC society proposed more rigorous and demanding diagnostic methods with specific classification criteria so that it cannot be confused with other, similar conditions. Specifically, they require that a patient must have pain associated with the bladder, accompanied by one other urinary symptom. Thus, a patient with just frequency or urgency would be excluded from a diagnosis. Secondly, they strongly encourage the exclusion of confusable diseases through an extensive and expensive series of tests including (A) a medical history and physical exam, (B) a dipstick urinalysis, various urine cultures, and a serum PSA in men over 40, (C) flowmetry and post-void residual urine volume by ultrasound scanning and (D) cystoscopy. A diagnosis of BPS\/IC would be confirmed with a hydrodistention during cystoscopy with biopsy.They also propose a ranking system based upon the physical findings in the bladder. Patients would receive a numeric and letter based score based upon the severity of their disease as found during the hydrodistention. A score of 1-3 would relate to the severity of the disease and a rating of A-C represents biopsy findings. Thus, a patient with 1A would have very mild symptoms and disease while a patient with 3C would have the worst available symptoms.In 2009, Japanese researchers identified a urinary marker called phenylacetylglutamine that could be used for early diagnosis.Pelvic floor treatments.Work by Wise and Anderson (see details) has shown that urologic pelvic pain syndromes, such as BPS\/IC and CP\/CPPS, may have no initial trigger other than anxiety, often with an element of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or other anxiety-spectrum problem. This is theorized to leave the pelvic area in a sensitized condition resulting in a loop of muscle tension and heightened neurological feedback (neural wind-up). This is a form of myofascial pain syndrome. Current protocols largely focus on stretches to release overtensed muscles in the pelvic or anal area (commonly referred to as trigger points), physical therapy to the area, and progressive relaxation therapy to reduce causative stress.Pelvic floor dysfunction is a fairly new area of specialty for physical therapists world wide. The goal of therapy is to relax and lengthen the pelvic floor muscles, rather than to tighten and\/or strengthen them as is the goal of therapy for patients with incontinence. Thus, traditional exercises such as Kegels, can be helpful as they strengthen the muscles, however they can provoke pain and additional muscle tension. A specially trained physical therapist can provide direct, hands on, evaluation of the muscles, both externally and internally. While weekly therapy is certainly valuable, most providers also suggest an aggressive self-care regimen at home to help combat muscle tension, such as daily muscle relaxation audiotapes, stress reduction and anxiety management on a daily basis. Anxiety is often found in patients with painful conditions and can subconsciously trigger muscle tension.Thiele massage.Transvaginal manual therapy of the pelvic floor musculature (Thiele massage) has shown promise in relieving the pain associated with Interstitial cystitis in at least one open, clinical pilot study.Medication.As recently as a decade ago, treatments available were limited to the use of astringent instillations, such as chlorpactin (oxychlorosene) or silver nitrate, designed to kill \"infection\" and\/or strip off the bladder lining. In 2005, our understanding of BPS\/IC has improved dramatically and these therapies are now no longer done. Rather, BPS\/IC therapy is typically multi-modal, including the use of a bladder coating, an antihistamine to help control mast cell activity and a low dose antidepressant to fight neurogenic inflammation.Pentosan polysulfate.Oral pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron) is believed to provide a protective coating in the bladder, but studies show it is not statistically significant compared to placebo. However, some studies have found that a minority of patients do respond to pentosan polysulfate.Amitriptyline.Amitriptyline can reduce symptoms in patients with BPS\/IC. Patient overall satisfaction with the therapeutic result of amitriptyline was excellent or good in 46%.Bladder instillations.DMSO, a wood pulp extract, is the only approved bladder instillation for BPS\/IC yet it is much less frequently used in urology clinics. Research studies presented at recent conferences of the American Urological Association by C. Subah Packer have demonstrated that the FDA approved dosage of a 50% solution of DMSO had the potential of creating irreversible muscle contraction. However, a lesser solution of 25% was found to be reversible. Long term use is questionable, at best, particularly given the fact that the method of action of DMSO is not fully understood.Rescue instillations.More recently, the use of a \"rescue instillation\" composed of Elmiron or heparin, Cystistat, lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate, has generated considerable excitement in the BPS\/IC community because it is the first therapeutic intervention that can be used to reduce a flare of symptoms. Published studies report a 90% effectiveness in reducing symptoms.Bladder coatings.Diet.The foundation of therapy is a modification of diet to help patients avoid those foods which can further irritate the damaged bladder wall. Common offenders are highly spiced or acidic foods and include alcohol, coffees, teas, herbal teas, green teas, all sodas (particularly diet), concentrated fruit juices, tomatoes, citrus fruit, cranberries, the B vitamins, vitamin C, monosodium glutamate, chocolate, and potassium-rich foods such as bananas. Most BPS\/IC support groups and many urology clinics have diet lists available.The problem with diet triggers is that they vary from person to person: the best way for a person to discover his or her own triggers is to use an elimination diet.Anecdotal evidence has linked gluten intolerance to UCPPS symptoms. Studies are lacking in this area.Bladder distension.Bladder distension (a procedure which stretches the bladder capacity, done under general anaesthesia) has shown some success in reducing urinary frequency and giving pain relief to patients. However, many experts still cannot understand precisely \"how\" this can cause pain relief. Recent studies showing that pressure on pelvic trigger points can relieve symptoms may be connected. Unfortunately, the relief achieved by bladder distensions is only temporary (weeks or months) and consequently, it is not really viable as a long-term treatment for BPS\/IC.Surgery.Surgical interventions are rarely used for BPS\/IC. Surgical intervention is very unpredicatable for BPS\/IC, and is considered a treatment of last resort when all other treatment modalities have failed and pain is severe. Some patients who opt for surgical intervention continue to experience pain after surgery. Surgical interventions for BPS\/IC include transurethral fulguration and resection of ulcers, using electricity\/laser; bladder denervation, where some of the nerves to the bladder are cut(Modified Ingelman-Sundberg Procedure); bladder augmentation; bladder removal (cystectomy); electrical nerve stimulation, similar to TENS, where an electrical unit is implanted in the body and provides continuous or intermittent electrical pulses to the affected areas (Interstim); spinal cord stimulation (SCS), where an electrical unit is implanted that provides electrical stimulation to the spinal cord, interfering with pain reception to the brain (ANS\/ Advanced Neuromodulation Systems spinal Cord Stumulator); and the implantation of the intrathecal pain pump, where very small amounts of medication, like morphine sulfate, dilaudid, or baclophen are released into the cerebrospinal fluid via a catheter stemming from the small electrical pump, requiring only about 1\/100 to 1\/300 the amount of medication needed orally for the same therapeutic benefit, but with much fewer side effects.Pain control.Pain control is usually necessary in the BPS\/IC treatment plan. The pain of BPS\/IC has been rated equivalent to cancer pain and may lead to central sensitization if untreated.Medication.The use of a variety of traditional pain medications, including opiates and synthetic opioids like tramadol, is often necessary to treat the varying degrees of pain. Even children with BPS\/IC should be appropriately addressed regarding pelvic pain, and receive necessary treatment to manage it.Neuromodulation.Neuromodulation can be successful in treating BPS\/IC symptoms, including pain. Electronic pain-killing options include TENS. PTNS stimulators have also been used, with varying degrees of success. Percutaneous sacral nerve root stimulation (PNS) was able to produce statistically significant improvements in several parameters, including pain.Acupuncture.A 2002 review study reported that acupuncture alleviates pain associated with BPS\/IC as part of multimodal treatment. While a 1987 study showed that 11 of 14 (78%) patients had a &gt;50% reduction in pain, another study (published in 1993) found no beneficial effect. A 2008 review found that although there are hardly any controlled studies on alternative medicine and BPS\/IC, \"rather good results have been obtained\" when acupuncture is combined with other treatments.Biofeedback.Biofeedback, a relaxation technique aimed at helping people control functions of the autonomous nervous system, has shown some benefit in controlling pain associated with BPS\/IC as part of a multimodal approach that may also include medication or hydrodistention of the bladder.Links to other conditions.It is important to note that some people with BPS\/IC suffer from anxiety disorder, and other conditions that may have the same etiology as BPS\/IC. These include: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, endometriosis, vulvodynia, and chemical sensitivities. Men with BPS\/IC are frequently diagnosed as having chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, and there is an extensive overlap of symptoms and treatment between the two conditions, leading researchers to posit that the conditions share the same etiology and pathology.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q237","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Interstitial cystitis.Interstitial cystitis or Bladder pain syndrome\/interstitial cystitis (commo...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID237"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID575","SecondaryAttribute":"Introduction \u00a0Library management systems (LMS), also known as integrated library systems, are use..","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Introduction<\/div><div>&nbsp;Library management systems (LMS), also known as integrated library systems, are used by libraries to inventory collections and manage user records. The LMS stores personal information collected from patrons for a variety of reasons and maintains records of what items patrons borrow, the holds they place, and fines or fees they may incur. In addition, the LMS may share data with or provides services to other systems employed by the library, for example to provide authentication for online resources.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Libraries must work to ensure that their procedures and practices for managing the LMS reflect library ethics, policies, and legal obligations concerning user privacy and confidentiality. Agreements between libraries and vendors should specify that libraries retain ownership of all data; that the vendor agrees to observe the library's privacy, data retention, and security policies; and that the vendor agrees to bind any third parties it uses in delivering services to these policies as well.<\/div><div>&nbsp;These guidelines are issued by ALA to provide libraries using LMS with information about appropriate data management and security practices in respect to library patrons' personally identifiable information and data about their reading habits and use of library resources.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Why Privacy Is Important<\/div><div>&nbsp;Protecting user privacy and confidentiality has long been an integral part of the intellectual freedom mission of libraries. The right to free inquiry as assured by the First Amendment depends upon the ability to read and access information free from scrutiny by the government or other third parties. In their provision of services to library users, librarians have an ethical obligation, expressed in the ALA Code of Ethics, to preserve users' right to privacy. Librarians and libraries may also have a legal obligation to protect library users' personally identifiable information and data from unauthorized disclosure and use.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Clear Privacy Policies<\/div><div>&nbsp;Users should be notified about library privacy policies when registering for a library card or borrowing materials for the first time. Library privacy policies should be made easily available and understandable to users in an accessible format. Safeguarding user privacy requires that individuals know what personally identifiable information is gathered about them, how long it is stored, who has access to it and under what conditions, and how it is used. A proactive process should be created to notify ongoing users of any changes to the library's privacy policies.<\/div><div>&nbsp;User Consent<\/div><div>&nbsp;The library should give users of the LMS options as to how much personally identifiable information is collected from them and how it may be used. Users should have a choice about whether or not to opt-in to features and services that require the collection of personal information. Users should also have the ability to opt-out if they later change their minds and have the data collected during the opt-in phase be destroyed when possible. For example, if the LMS offers the ability to save the checkout history, this should be an opt-in feature not turned on as a default.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Access to Personal Data<\/div><div>&nbsp;Users should have the right to access their own personal information and evaluate its accuracy. Verifying accuracy helps ensure that library services that rely on personally identifiable information can function properly. Guidance on how the user can access their personal data held in the LMS should be clear and easy to find.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Access to personal information should be restricted to the user or appropriate library staff and conform to the applicable state laws addressing the confidentiality of library records as well as other applicable local, state, and federal law. In addition, state and federal laws may give parents, guardians, and educators access to the library records of minors (see Library Privacy Guidelines for Students in K-12 Schools in the Additional Resources section below).<\/div><div>&nbsp;Collection &amp; Retention of User Data<\/div><div>&nbsp;Libraries should limit the amount of personal information collected by the LMS about patrons. In general, the library should collect the minimum amount of personal information required to provide a service or meet a specific operational need. Library policies developed around the collection of personal information should also cover the use of any free-text note fields associated with the patron's record.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Personally identifiable information should not be retained in perpetuity. The library should establish policies for how long to retain different types of data and methods for securely destroying data that is no longer needed. For example, accounts that are expired or inactive for a certain amount of time should be purged. Retention policies should also cover archival copies and backups.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Encryption<\/div><div>&nbsp;All online transactions between client applications (staff desktop clients, web browsers, mobile apps, etc.) and server applications should be encrypted using modern, up-to-date security protocols for SSL\/HTTPS. Client applications that do not support encryption (such as staff desktop clients) should employ virtual private network (VPN) technologies.<\/div><div>&nbsp;In addition, any personally identifiable information and user data housed by the library off-site (cloud-based infrastructure, tape backups, etc.) should use encrypted storage.<\/div><div>&nbsp;PINs &amp; Passwords<\/div><div>&nbsp;User personal identification numbers (PINs) and passwords stored in the LMS should be encrypted so that only the user has access to them, i.e. library staff cannot view them. This encryption should use up-to-date best practices. Currently, this means that passwords should be salted and hashed with a SHA-2 hash function, but library personnel responsible for password security should stay current on best practices. In addition, the LMS should provide users with the ability to set their PIN or password themselves without having to reveal it to library staff.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Notifications &amp; Reports<\/div><div>&nbsp;User notifications for holds, overdue items, and fines should contain minimal personal information especially if sent through insecure communication (e.g. email, text message, postcards). Users could be encouraged to login to a secure account for more details. If the LMS provides the ability to include notification history as part of the patron record, this should be offered as an opt-in feature for patrons and not turned on by default.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Access to LMS reports that contain personally identifiable information should be restricted to appropriate library staff. Reports intended for wider distribution should be anonymized by removing or encrypting personally identifiable information.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Libraries that combine patron information from the LMS with external demographic information for analytics should take measures to protect reader privacy. Aggregation and anonymization should be employed to help prevent the identification of reading habits and library usage with specific individuals. Because of the growing threat of reidentification techniques, access to anonymized data sets should still be restricted to appropriate users.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Data Sharing<\/div><div>&nbsp;It has become common practice for organizations to share data including personally identifiable information with third-parties. However, most state statutes on the confidentiality of library records do not permit release of library patrons' personally identifiable information or data about their use of library resources and services without user consent or a court order, although some state library confidentiality statutes permit sharing this data with parents or guardians of minors. In addition, ALA policy forbids sharing of library patron information with third parties without user consent or a court order.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Government Requests<\/div><div>&nbsp;The library should develop and implement procedures for dealing with government and law enforcement requests for library patrons' personally identifiable information and use data held within the LMS. The library should consider a government or law enforcement request only if it is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that shows good cause and is in proper form. The library should also inform users through its privacy policies about the legal conditions under which it might be required to release personally identifiable information.<\/div><div>&nbsp;The library could consider publishing a warrant canary notice to inform users that they have not been served with a secret government subpoena or national security letter. If a canary notice is not updated or it is removed, users can assume that a subpoena or national security letter has been served (see Canary Warrants Frequently Asked Questions in the Additional Resources section below).<\/div><div>&nbsp;Privacy Awareness<\/div><div>&nbsp;Library staff who have access to patron data in the LMS should receive training on the library's privacy policies and best practices for safeguarding patron privacy.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Libraries should establish and maintain effective mechanisms to enforce their privacy policies. They should conduct regular privacy audits to ensure that all operations and services comply with these policies. A library that suffers a violation in its privacy policies through inadvertent dissemination or data theft must notify the affected users about this urgent matter as soon as the library is aware of the data breach and describe what steps are being taken to remedy the situation or mitigate the possible damage.<\/div><div>&nbsp;[The Library Privacy Checklist for Library Management Systems\/Integrated Library Systems is intended to help libraries of all capacities take practical steps to implement the principles that are laid out in this guideline.]<\/div><div>&nbsp;Additional Resources<\/div><div>&nbsp;Canary Warrants Frequently Asked Questions, Electronic Frontier Foundation<\/div><div>&nbsp;Library Privacy Guidelines for Students in K-12 Schools, Intellectual Freedom Committee of the American Library Association<\/div><div>&nbsp;NISO Consensus Principles on Users Digital Privacy in Library, Publisher, and Software-Provider Systems, National Information Standards Organization<\/div><div>&nbsp;Privacy Toolkit, Intellectual Freedom Committee of the American Library Association<\/div><div>&nbsp;Approved June 24, 2016 by the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the American Library Association&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q575","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Introduction \u00a0Library management systems (LMS), also known as integrated library systems, are use...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID575"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID233","SecondaryAttribute":"Ion channel.Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that help establish and control the small volt...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Ion channel.Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that help establish and control the small voltage gradient across the plasma membrane of all living cells (see cell potential) by allowing the flow of ions down their electrochemical gradient. They are present in the membranes that surround all biological cells. The study of ion channels involves many scientific techniques such as voltage clamp electrophysiology (in particular patch clamp), immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR.Basic features.Biological role.Because \"voltage-activated\" channels underlie the nerve impulse and because \"transmitter-activated\" channels mediate conduction across the synapses, channels are especially prominent components of the nervous system. Indeed, most of the offensive and defensive toxins that organisms have evolved for shutting down the nervous systems of predators and prey (e.g., the venoms produced by spiders, scorpions, snakes, fish, bees, sea snails and others) work by modulating ion channel conductance and\/or kinetics. In addition, ion channels are key components in a wide variety of biological processes that involve rapid changes in cells, such as cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle contraction, epithelial transport of nutrients and ions, T-cell activation and pancreatic beta-cell insulin release. In the search for new drugs, ion channels are a frequent target.Diversity.Ion channels may be classified by the nature of their gating, the species of ions passing through those gates, and the number of gates (pores).By gating.Ion channels may be classified by gating, i.e. what opens and closes the channels. Voltage-gated ion channels open or close depending on the voltage gradient across the plasma membrane, while ligand-gated ion channels open or close depending on binding of ligands to the channel.Voltage-gated.Voltage-gated ion channels open and close in response to membrane potential.Ligand-gated.Ion channels activated by second messengers may also be categorized in this group, although ligands and second messengers are otherwise distinguished from each other.Other gating.Other gating include activation\/inactivation by e.g. second messengers from the inside of the cell membrane, rather as from outside, as in the case for ligands. Ions may count to such second messengers, and then causes direct activation, rather than indirect, as in the case were the electric potential of ions cause activation\/inactivation of voltage-gated ion channels.Other classifications.There are other types of ion channel classifications that are based on less normal characteristics, e.g. multiple pores and transient potentials.Detailed structure.Because of their small size and the difficulty of crystallizing integral membrane proteins for X-ray analysis, it is only very recently that scientists have been able to directly examine what channels \"look like.\" Particularly in cases where the crystallography required removing channels from their membranes with detergent, many researchers regard images that have been obtained as tentative. An example is the long-awaited crystal structure of a voltage-gated potassium channel, which was reported in May 2003. The detailed 3D structure of the magnesium channel from bacteria can be seen. One inevitable ambiguity about these structures relates to the strong evidence that channels change conformation as they operate (they open and close, for example), such that the structure in the crystal could represent any one of these operational states. Most of what researchers have deduced about channel operation so far they have established through electrophysiology, biochemistry, gene sequence comparison and mutagenesis.Diseases of ion channels.There are a number of chemicals and genetic disorders which disrupt normal functioning of ion channels and have disastrous consequences for the organism. Genetic disorders of ion channels and their modifiers are known as Channelopathies. See for a full list.History.The fundamental properties of currents mediated by ion channels were analyzed by the British biophysicists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley as part of their Nobel Prize-winning research on the action potential, published in 1952. They built on the work of other physiologists, such as Cole and Baker's research into voltage-gated membrane pores from 1941. The existence of ion channels was confirmed in the 1970s by Bernard Katz and Ricardo Miledi using noise analysis. It was then shown more directly with an electrical recording technique known as the \"patch clamp,\" which led to a Nobel Prize to Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, the technique's inventors. Hundreds if not thousands of researchers continue to pursue a more detailed understanding of how these proteins work. In recent years the development of automated patch clamp devices helped to increase significantly the throughput in ion channel screening.The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2003 was awarded to two American scientists: Roderick MacKinnon for his studies on the physico-chemical properties of ion channel structure and function, including x-ray crystallographic structure studies, and Peter Agre for his similar work on aquaporins.The ion channel in fine art.Roderick MacKinnon commissioned \"Birth of an Idea\", a 5' (1.50 m) tall sculpture based on the KcsA potassium channel. The artwork contains a wire object representing the pore liner with a blown glass object representing the main cavity of the channel structure.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q233","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Ion channel.Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that help establish and control the small volt...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID233"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID234","SecondaryAttribute":"Ion channels are key components that involve rapid changes in cells in which biological processes...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e031180-fb1c-58dd-bb93-ab474d53e471\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Ion channels are key components that involve rapid changes in cells in which biological processes?

His political career, having suffered several controversies, ended after a conviction for perverting the course of justice and his subsequent imprisonment. He is married to Mary Archer, a scientist specialising in solar power.Early life and background.Jeffrey Howard Archer was born in the City of London Maternity Hospital. He was two weeks old when his family moved to the seaside town of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, where he spent most of his early life. His father, William, was sixty-four when Archer was born. He died when Archer was fifteen. In 1951, he won a scholarship to Wellington School, in Somerset (not to be confused with the public school Wellington College, which is possible from the ambiguous biography in Archer's earlier books). At this time his mother, Lola, contributed a column \"Over the teacups\" to the local press in Weston-super-Mare and wrote about the adventures of her son 'Tuppence'; this caused Archer to be the victim of bullying while at Wellington School.After Archer left school passing O-levels in English Literature, Art, and History, he worked in a number of jobs, including training with the army and for the police. This lasted only for a few months, but he fared better as a Physical Education teacher; first at Vicar's Hill School in Hampshire, and later at the more prestigious Dover College in Kent. As a teacher he was popular with pupils and reported by some to have had good motivational skills.Oxford.He gained a place at Brasenose College, Oxford to study for a one-year diploma in education, though he stayed for three years, gaining an academic qualification in teaching awarded by the Oxford Department for Education. There have been claims that Archer provided false evidence of his academic qualifications, for instance the apparent citing of an American institution which was actually a bodybuilding club, in gaining admission to Oxford University. His website includes references to his Oxford 'Principal', yet omits that he was not a full undergraduate at Oxford.It was during this period that he met his wife, Mary. They married in July 1966.Early career.One organisation Archer worked for, the United Nations Association, alleged discrepancies in his claims for expenses, and details appeared in the press in a scrambled form. Archer brought a defamation action against the former Conservative member of parliament Humphry Berkeley, chairman of the UNA, as the source of the allegations. The case was settled out of court after three years. Berkeley tried to persuade Conservative Central Office that Archer was unsuitable as a parliamentary candidate, but a selection meeting at Louth disregarded any doubts.Archer set up his own fund-raising company, Arrow Enterprises, in 1969. That same year he opened an art gallery, the Archer Gallery, in Mayfair. The gallery specialised in modern art, including pieces by the acclaimed sculptor and painter Leon Underwood. The gallery ultimately lost money, however, and Archer sold it two years later.Member of Parliament.At 29, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Lincolnshire constituency of Louth, holding the seat for the Conservative Party in a by-election on 4 December 1969. Archer beat Ian Gow to the selection after winning over a substantial proportion of younger members at the selection meeting. Archer's campaign colour was a dayglo orange\/pink with a blue arrow; the political parties in Lincolnshire had not yet abandoned local colours, which were different from the party national colours.Louth constituency had three key areas: Louth, Cleethorpes, and Immingham. During his time as a Member of Parliament, Archer was a regular at the Immingham Conservative Club in the most working-class part of the constituency.In Parliament, Archer was on the left of the Conservative Party, rebelling against some of his party's policies. He urged free TV licences for the elderly and was against museum charges. Archer voted against restoring capital punishment, saying it was barbaric and obscene. In 1971, he employed David Mellor, then needing money for his bar finals, to deal with his correspondence. He tipped Mellor to reach the cabinet. In an interview Archer said \"I hope we don't return to extremes. I'm what you might call centre-right but I've always disliked the right wing as much as I've disliked the left wing.\"In 1974, he was a casualty of a fraudulent investment scheme involving Aquablast, a Canadian company, a debacle which lost Archer his first fortune. Fearing imminent bankruptcy, he stood down as an MP at the October 1974 general election. By this time the Archers were living in a large five-bedroom house in The Boltons, an exclusive street in South Kensington. As a result of the Aquablast affair, they were forced to sell the house and move into more modest accommodation for a while.Archer remained president of Immingham Conservative Party until he withdrew from the 2000 election for Mayor of London in 1999. Archer is considered a local celebrity by people of Immingham who were around when he was their Member of Parliament (although Archer has no family or business connection with the area). His rare visits to northern Lincolnshire attract considerable local public interest.Politics and writing.His first book, \"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less\", was picked up by the literary agent Deborah Owen and published first in the US, then eventually in Britain in the Autumn of 1976. The book was an instant success and Archer avoided bankruptcy, never being legally declared bankrupt. A BBC Television adaptation of the book was broadcast in 1990, and a radio adaptation was aired on BBC Radio 4 in the early 1980s. While he was a witness in the Aquablast case in Toronto in 1977, Archer was accused of taking three suits from a department store, an accusation he denied for many years. However, in the late 1990s, Archer finally acknowledged that he had indeed taken the suits, although he claimed that at the time he hadn't realised he had left the shop. No charges were brought.\"Kane and Abel\" proved to be his best-selling work, reaching number one on the \"New York Times\" bestsellers list. It was made into a television mini-series by CBS in 1985, starring Peter Strauss and Sam Neill. The following year, Granada TV screened a ten-part adaptation of another Archer bestseller, \"First Among Equals\", which told the story of three men and their quest to become Prime Minister. Archer claims to spend considerable time writing and re-writing each book. He goes abroad to write the first draft, working in blocks of two-hours at a time, then writes anything up to seventeen further drafts. It has been suggested that his books require extensive editing by others to make them readable.In 1979, Archer purchased the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, a house associated with the poet Rupert Brooke. He also began to hold shepherd's pie and Krug parties for prominent people at his London apartment, which overlooks the Houses of Parliament.Archer's political career revived once he became known for his novels and as a popular speaker among the Conservative grassroots. He was made deputy chairman of the Conservative Party by Margaret Thatcher in September 1985. Norman Tebbit, party chairman, had misgivings over the appointment, as did other prominent members of the party, including William Whitelaw and Ted Heath. During his tenure as deputy chairman, Archer was responsible for a number of embarrassing gaffes, including his claim, made during a live radio interview, that many young, unemployed people were simply unwilling to find work. At the time of Archer's comment, unemployment in the UK stood at a record 3.4 million. Archer was later forced to apologise for the remark, suggesting that his words had been \"taken out of context\".Peerage.In 1992, after having been previously rejected, Archer was made a life peer as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, of Mark in the County of Somerset by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister John Major.In a speech at the 1993 Conservative conference, Archer urged the Home Secretary Michael Howard, to \"Stand and deliver\" saying: \"Michael, I am sick and tired of being told by old people that they are frightened to open the door, they're frightened to go out at night, frightened to use the parks and byways where their parents and grandparents walked with freedom... We say to you: stand and deliver!\". He then attacked violent films and urged tougher prison conditions to prevent criminals from re-offending. He criticised the role of \"do-gooders\" and finished off the speech by denouncing the opposition party's Law and Order policies.. On \"Question Time\" in February 1994, Archer stated that 18 should be the age of consent for homosexuality, as opposed to 21, which it was at the time. Archer has also consistently been an opponent of a return to capital punishment.\"Daily Star\" libel case.There was astonishment at the description the judge (Mr Justice Caulfield) gave of Mrs Archer in his jury instructions: \"Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box. Your vision of her probably will never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey?\" The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer, \"Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?\" By this time, according to the journalist Adam Raphael, Jeffrey and Mary Archer were, in fact, living largely separate lives.The editor of the \"Daily Star\", Lloyd Turner, was sacked six weeks after the trial by the paper's owner Lord Stevens of Ludgate.Share dealings.An inquiry was launched by the Stock Exchange into possible insider trading. The Department of Trade and Industry, headed by Michael Heseltine, announced that Archer would not be prosecuted. Archer later claimed that he had been \"exonerated\", but the DTI inquiry had merely stated that there was insufficient evidence to bring a prosecution.Missing Kurdish aid.In July 2001, Scotland Yard began investigating allegations that millions of pounds had disappeared from \"Simple Truth\", a fundraising campaign run by Archer. He set up a charity with the Red Cross. He employed two Kurdish aides, Broosk Saib and Nadhim Zahawi, whom he nicknamed \"Lemon Kurd and Bean Kurd.\"Perjury and downfall.Archer had been selected by the Conservative Party as candidate for the London mayoral election of 2000. He was forced to withdraw when it was revealed that he was facing a charge of perjury.In November 1999, Ted Francis, a friend (who claimed Archer owed him money) and Archer's former personal assistant Angela Peppiatt claimed he had fabricated an alibi in the 1987 trial. They were concerned that Archer was standing as Mayor of London and doubted that he was suitable. Peppiatt had kept a diary of Archer's movements, which contradicted evidence given during the 1987 trial. This formed the basis of the case against Archer.The \"News of the World\" published the allegations on 21 November 1999 and Archer withdrew his candidacy the following day. Conservative leader William Hague said \"This is the end of politics for Jeffrey Archer. I will not tolerate such behaviour in my party\". On 8 October, he had described Archer as a candidate of \"probity and integrity. I'm going to back him all the way\" at the Conservative party conference.On 4 February 2000, Archer was expelled from the Conservative Party for five years. On 26 September 2000, he was charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice during the 1987 libel trial.A few months before the beginning of the perjury trial, Archer began in the star role in a courtroom play (which he also wrote) called \"The Accused\". The play was staged at London's Theatre Royal Haymarket and concerned the court trial of an alleged murderer from beginning to end. The play used the technique of assigning the role of jury in the trial to the audience, theatre-goers voting on whether Archer's character was guilty at the end of each performance. Archer would attend his real trial during the day and be judged in his fictional trial in the evening.The real trial began on 30 May 2001, a month after Monica Coghlan's death. On 19 July 2001, Archer was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at the 1987 trial. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment by Mr Justice Potts. Archer never spoke during the trial, though his wife Mary again gave evidence as she had done during the 1987 trial. Ted Francis was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice. Archer's mother died on 11 July 2001 aged 87, and he was released for the day on 21 July to attend the funeral.Archer was sent to Belmarsh Prison, but was moved to the category \"C\" Wayland Prison in Norfolk on 9 August 2001. Despite automatically qualifying as a category \"D\" prisoner given it was a first conviction and he did not pose serious risk of harm to the public, his status as such was suspended pending a police investigation into Baroness Emma Nicholson's allegations that he had kept funds meant for the \"Simple Truth\" campaign. He was finally transferred to HMP North Sea Camp, an open prison in October 2001. From there he was let out to work at the Theatre Royal in Lincoln, England, and was allowed occasional home visits. Reports in the media claimed he had been abusing this privilege by attending lunches with friends, including former Education Secretary Gillian Shephard and in September 2002 he was transferred to Lincoln Prison for a month. While in prison, he wrote the three-volume memoir \"A Prison Diary\". During his time in prison, he was visited by a number of high-profile friends, including the actor Donald Sinden and the performer Barry Humphries.On 21 July 2003, he was released on licence, after serving half of his sentence, from HMP Hollesley Bay, Suffolk.Many of Archer's friends remained loyal. He and Lady Archer were guests at the memorial service for Norris McWhirter at Saint Martin-in-the-Fields on Thursday 7 October 2004 where they sat in the same pew as former head of the Conservative Monday Club, Gregory Lauder-Frost, and in front of Lady Thatcher, who embraced Lady Archer.On 26 February 2006, on Andrew Marr's \"Sunday AM\" programme, Archer said he had no interest in returning to front-line politics: he would pursue his writing instead. He has confirmed this when speaking at the Emmanuel College Politics Society and the Christ's Politics Society at the University of Cambridge.Archer in fiction.In \"There's No Place Like a Home\", a comedy play by Paul Elliot, the residents of a retirement home for actors and actresses, trying to prevent its closure, kidnap Archer to use the ransom money to keep their home open.The satirical magazine Private Eye refers to Archer as 'Jeffrey Archole' or 'Lord Archole' and characterises him as a liar and fantasist. On occasion it has published spoofs of Archer's fiction, describing a thinly-veiled heroic version of himself called 'Jeremy Bowman'.Archer portrayed himself in a brief portion of \"Bridget Jones's Diary\". The joke was that Bridget always says the wrong thing and was introducing \"The greatest book of our time\" and then spots several famous (and better according to the joke) authors in the crowd, one of which is Lord Archer.In an episode of \"Cluedo\", Reverend Green compares himself to Jeffery Archer in his murder confession.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Jeffrey Archer.Jeffrey Howard Archer, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare (born 15 April 1940) is a...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div><div><div><div>In 983, when Henry II, Duke of Bavaria rebelled against the then child Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor, the Magyars occupied Melk.

His political career, having suffered several controversies, ended after a conviction for perverting the course of justice and his subsequent imprisonment. He is married to Mary Archer, a scientist specialising in solar power.Early life and background.Jeffrey Howard Archer was born in the City of London Maternity Hospital. He was two weeks old when his family moved to the seaside town of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, where he spent most of his early life. His father, William, was sixty-four when Archer was born. He died when Archer was fifteen. In 1951, he won a scholarship to Wellington School, in Somerset (not to be confused with the public school Wellington College, which is possible from the ambiguous biography in Archer's earlier books). At this time his mother, Lola, contributed a column \"Over the teacups\" to the local press in Weston-super-Mare and wrote about the adventures of her son 'Tuppence'; this caused Archer to be the victim of bullying while at Wellington School.After Archer left school passing O-levels in English Literature, Art, and History, he worked in a number of jobs, including training with the army and for the police. This lasted only for a few months, but he fared better as a Physical Education teacher; first at Vicar's Hill School in Hampshire, and later at the more prestigious Dover College in Kent. As a teacher he was popular with pupils and reported by some to have had good motivational skills.Oxford.He gained a place at Brasenose College, Oxford to study for a one-year diploma in education, though he stayed for three years, gaining an academic qualification in teaching awarded by the Oxford Department for Education. There have been claims that Archer provided false evidence of his academic qualifications, for instance the apparent citing of an American institution which was actually a bodybuilding club, in gaining admission to Oxford University. His website includes references to his Oxford 'Principal', yet omits that he was not a full undergraduate at Oxford.It was during this period that he met his wife, Mary. They married in July 1966.Early career.One organisation Archer worked for, the United Nations Association, alleged discrepancies in his claims for expenses, and details appeared in the press in a scrambled form. Archer brought a defamation action against the former Conservative member of parliament Humphry Berkeley, chairman of the UNA, as the source of the allegations. The case was settled out of court after three years. Berkeley tried to persuade Conservative Central Office that Archer was unsuitable as a parliamentary candidate, but a selection meeting at Louth disregarded any doubts.Archer set up his own fund-raising company, Arrow Enterprises, in 1969. That same year he opened an art gallery, the Archer Gallery, in Mayfair. The gallery specialised in modern art, including pieces by the acclaimed sculptor and painter Leon Underwood. The gallery ultimately lost money, however, and Archer sold it two years later.Member of Parliament.At 29, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Lincolnshire constituency of Louth, holding the seat for the Conservative Party in a by-election on 4 December 1969. Archer beat Ian Gow to the selection after winning over a substantial proportion of younger members at the selection meeting. Archer's campaign colour was a dayglo orange\/pink with a blue arrow; the political parties in Lincolnshire had not yet abandoned local colours, which were different from the party national colours.Louth constituency had three key areas: Louth, Cleethorpes, and Immingham.

Jerome.Jerome was born in Caldmore, Walsall, England, where he is honoured in a display at Walsall Museum, and was brought up in poverty in London.Other works include the essay collections \"Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow\" and \"Second Thoughts of an Idle Fellow\"; \"Three Men on the Bummel\", a sequel to \"Three Men in a Boat\"; and several other novels.Early life.The young Jerome wished to go into politics or be a man of letters, but the death of both his parents in 1872, when he was 13 years old, forced him to quit his studies and find work to support himself. He was employed at the London and North Western Railway, initially collecting coal that fell along the railway, and remained there for four years.Acting career and early literary works.\"Three Men in a Boat\" and later career.Jerome sat down to write \"Three Men in a Boat\" as soon as the couple returned from their honeymoon. In the novel, his wife was replaced by his longtime friends George Wingrave (George) and Carl Hentschel (Harris). This allowed him to create comic (and non-sentimental) situations which were nonetheless intertwined with the history of the Thames region. The book, published in 1889, became an instant success and is still in print. Its popularity was such that the number of registered Thames boats went up fifty percent in the year following its publication, and it contributed significantly to the Thames becoming a tourist attraction. In its first twenty years alone, the book sold over a million copies worldwide. It has been adapted to movies, TV and radio shows, stage plays, and even a musical. Its writing style influenced many humorists and satirists in England and elsewhere. Its endurance can probably be attributed to the style and choice of a relatively unchanged location, which ensures that the basic setting remains relevant, even as other things change.With the financial security the sales of the book provided, Jerome was able to dedicate all of his time to writing. He wrote a number of plays, essays and novels, but was never able to recapture the success of \"Three Men in a Boat\". In 1892 he was chosen by Robert Barr to edit \"The Idler\" (over Rudyard Kipling). The magazine was an illustrated satirical monthly catering to gentlemen (who, following the theme of the publication, appreciated idleness). In 1893 he founded \"To-Day\", but had to withdraw from both publications because of financial difficulties and a libel suit.In 1898, a short stay in Germany inspired \"Three Men on the Bummel\", the sequel to \"Three Men in a Boat\". While reintroducing the same characters in the setting of a foreign bicycle tour, the book was nonetheless unable to capture the life-force and historic roots of its predecessor, and it enjoyed only a mild success. In 1902 he published the novel \"Paul Kelver\", which is widely regarded as autobiographical. His 1908 play \"The Passing of the Third Floor Back\" introduced a more sombre and religious Jerome. This was a tremendous commercial success but was condemned by critics - Max Beerbohm described it as \"vilely stupid\" and as written by a \"tenth-rate writer\".World War I and last years.Jerome volunteered to serve his country at the outbreak of the war, but, being 56 years old, was rejected by the British Army. Eager to serve in some capacity, he volunteered as an ambulance driver for the French Army. The war experience was said to have dampened his spirit, as did the death in 1921 of his stepdaughter, Elsie.In 1926, Jerome published his autobiography, \"My Life and Times\". Shortly afterwards, the Borough of Walsall conferred on him the title Freeman of the Borough. During these last years, Jerome spent more time at his farmhouse in Ewelme near Wallingford.In June 1927, on a motoring tour from Devon to London via Cheltenham and Northampton, Jerome suffered a paralytic stroke and a cerebral haemorrhage. He lay in Northampton General Hospital for two weeks before succumbing on 14 June. He was cremated at Golders Green and his ashes buried at St Mary's Church, Ewelme, Oxfordshire.

He is now serving a 20-year prison sentence in connection with his participation in Afghanistan's Taliban army. He was captured during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, a violent Taliban prison uprising where American CIA officer Johnny \"Mike\" Spann was killed.Lindh received training at Al-Farouq, an alleged Al-Qaeda training camp located in Afghanistan. There, he attended a lecture by Osama bin Laden before the September 11, 2001 attacks. Lindh had previously received training with Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, an internationally designated terrorist organization based in Pakistan.Lindh went by Sulayman al-Faris during his time in Afghanistan, but prefers the name Hamza Walker Lindh today. In early reports following his capture, he was occasionally referred to by the news media as just \"John Walker\".Youth, conversion and travels.Lindh was born in Washington, D.C., to parents Marilyn Walker and Frank Lindh. He was baptized but not raised Roman Catholic, and grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland. When he was 10 years old, his family moved to San Anselmo, California. Lindh suffered from an intestinal disorder as a child. At age 14, Lindh's health improved and he enrolled at Redwood High School as a freshman. He then transferred to Tamiscal High School in the Tamalpais Union High School District, an alternative school offering self-directed, individualized study programs. While there, he studied world culture, including Islam and the Middle East. Lindh subsequently left the school and eventually earned a GED at age 16.As an adolescent, Lindh participated in IRC chat rooms. He became a devoted fan of hip-hop music, and engaged in extensive discussions on Usenet newsgroups, sometimes pretending to be an African American rapper who would criticize others for \"acting black\". The Spike Lee film \"Malcolm X\" impressed him deeply and sparked his interest in Islam.Although his parents did not officially divorce until 1999, their marriage was in serious trouble throughout Walker's adolescence, due to the fact that his father was homosexual and would often leave their Marin residence for extended periods to live in San Francisco with another man. Frank Lindh stated that they had been effectively separated since 1993. He recently remarried to his male partner of 10 years; the ceremony was performed on election day just before the passage of Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage in California.In 1997, John Lindh officially converted to Islam and began regularly attending mosques in Mill Valley and later San Francisco. In 1998 Lindh traveled to Yemen, and stayed for about 10 months to learn Arabic so that he would be able to read the Qur'an in its original language. He returned to the United States in 1999, living with his family for about eight months before returning to Yemen in February 2000, whence he left for Pakistan to study at a madrassa. While abroad, Lindh sent numerous emails to his family. In one, his father told him about the USS Cole bombing, to which Lindh replied that since the American destroyer was in the Yemen harbor, it was an act of war against Islam and therefore justified. \"This raised my concerns\", his father told Newsweek, \"but my days of molding him were over.\" Lindh had just turned 20.Lindh decided to travel to Afghanistan to fight for the Afghani Taliban government forces against the Afghan Northern Alliance fighters. His parents state that he was motivated by stories of atrocities perpetrated by Afghan Northern Alliance army against civilians. He traveled to Afghanistan in May 2001, contrary to reports after his arrest that implied or stated that he traveled to Afghanistan to kill Americans after 9\/11. American soldiers were not deployed in Afghanistan at the time he joined the Taliban government forces, making his alleged motivation of killing Americans doubtful. However, it should be noted that after the September 11 attacks, he knew the United States was now fighting alongside the Northern Alliance, yet he chose to stay and continue the fight.Though much has been made of the fact that Lindh did meet Osama bin Laden, his association with bin Laden was only a passing encounter and not an affiliation.Capture and interrogation.After the initial uprising Lindh found refuge in a basement bunker after taking a bullet in the right upper thigh, hiding with a group of Saudis, Uzbeks, and Pakistanis. He was found seven days later on December 2, 2001, when Northern Alliance forces diverted an irrigation stream, drowning many, and eventually flushing out Lindh and about 80 survivors from the original 300. The Northern Alliance captors then pinned Lindh's elbows behind his back.When interviewed by Pelton, Lindh initially gave his name as \"Abd-al-Hamid\" but later gave his birth name. Pelton brought a medic and food for Lindh and interviewed him about how he got there. Repeatedly Pelton asked Lindh if he wanted to call his parents or have Pelton do so, but as Pelton knew, Lindh was receiving his first medical treatment since being shot in the leg and had been given morphine by a medic prior to Pelton's interview. Lindh's parents maintain that Pelton acquired footage that was prejudicial and manipulative, and that Pelton contributed to the poor image of their son by sharing the footage with the world community without context. Lindh said during the interview that he was a member of Ansar (an Arabic word meaning \"Supporters\" or \"Helpers\"), a group of Arabic-speaking fighters financed by Osama bin Laden. Lindh said that the prison uprising was sparked by some of the prisoner guards smuggling grenades into the basement, \"This is against what we had agreed upon with the Northern Alliance, and this is against Islam. It is a major sin to break a contract, especially in military situations\".He was interrogated before the operation on December 14. While on the \"Peleliu\", he signed confession documents while he was held by the United States Marine Corps and informed his interrogators that he was not merely Taliban but al-Qaeda, though his father later asserted he was not involved in, and unaware of, al-Qaeda. On December 31, 2001, he was transferred to the USS \"Bataan\", where he was held until January 22, 2002, when he was flown off the \"Bataan\" to begin the journey back to the United States to face criminal charges. While on the USS \"Bataan\", Attorney General John Ashcroft, on January 16, 2002, announced that Lindh would be tried in the United States.His attorney claimed to the press that he asked for a lawyer repeatedly before being interviewed but he did not get one, and that \"highly coercive\" prison conditions forced Lindh to waive his right to remain silent. Although the FBI asked Jesselyn Radack, a Justice Department ethics advisor, whether Lindh could be questioned without a lawyer present, her advice that this should not be done was not followed.Trial.If convicted of these charges, Lindh could have received up to three life sentences and 90 additional years in prison. On February 13, 2002, he pled not guilty to all 10 charges.Lindh accepted this offer. On July 15, 2002, he entered his plea of guilty to the two remaining charges. The judge asked Lindh to say, in his own words, what he was admitting to. Lindh's allocution went as follows: \"I plead guilty\", he said. \"I provided my services as a soldier to the Taliban last year from about August to December. In the course of doing so, I carried a rifle and two grenades. I did so knowingly and willingly knowing that it was illegal.\" On October 4, 2002, Judge T.S. Ellis, III formally imposed the sentence: 20 years without parole.As another result of Lindh's plea bargain, a Son of Sam law was invoked. Any and all profits made from book deals or any movies about Lindh's experience will be automatically handed over to the federal government. Lindh, his family, his relatives, his associates and his friends will be unable to profit financially from his crimes and\/or experiences.Lindh's attorney, James Brosnahan, said Lindh would be eligible for release in 17 years, with good behavior. This is because, although there is no parole under federal law, his sentence could be reduced by 15 percent, or three years, for good behavior. In addition, Lindh agreed to cooperate \"fully, truthfully and completely\" with both military intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the terrorism investigation.Imprisonment.In January 2003, Lindh was sent to a medium-security prison in Victorville, northeast of Los Angeles. On March 3, 2003, Lindh was tackled by inmate Richard Dale Morrison, who assaulted Lindh as he knelt in prayer and then ran away; Lindh was left with bruises on his forehead. On July 2, 2003, Morrison was charged with a misdemeanor count of assault.Lindh was held at ADMAX in Florence, Colorado, the federal Supermax facility for a short time. He is currently serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Terre Haute, at Terre Haute, Indiana. In April 2007, citing the reduced sentence for the Australian prisoner David Hicks, Lindh's attorneys made a public plea for a Presidential commutation to lower his twenty year sentence.In January 2009 the Lindh family's petition for clemency to Lindh was denied by President Bush in one of his final acts in office. According to the US Justice Department, all \"special administrative measures\" in place against Lindh expired on March 20, 2009, as part of a gradual easing of restrictions on the prisoner.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q197","QuestionID":"QID197","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"John Walker Lindh.John Phillip Walker Lindh (born February 9, 1981) is an American citizen who wa...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[]}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID316","SecondaryAttribute":"John\u2019s mom made him eat which foods every morning?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e031180-fb3a-8e8f-ae77-fa0cbc6b4e5a\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;

The diagnosis of ASD now includes these other conditions: \n\u2022\t\nAutistic disorder\n\n\u2022\t\nAsperger\u2019s syndrome\n\n\u2022\t\nPervasive developmental disorder not  otherwise specified \n\n\nAlthough ASD begins in early development, it can last throughout a person\u2019s lifetime.   \nWhat are the signs and symptoms of ASD?\nNot all people with ASD will show all of these behaviors, but most will show several.\nPeople with ASD may:\n\u2022\t\nRepeat certain behaviors or have unusual behaviors\n\n\u2022\t\nHave overly focused interests, such as with moving objects or parts of objects\n\n\u2022\t\nHave a lasting, intense interest in certain topics, such as numbers, details, or facts\n\n\u2022\t\nBe upset by a slight change in a routine or being placed in a new or overstimulating setting  \n\n\u2022\t\nMake little or inconsistent eye contact\n\n\u2022\t\nTend to look and listen less to people in  their environment\n\n\u2022\t\nRarely seek to share their enjoyment of objects or activities by pointing or showing things to others\n\n\u2022\t\nRespond unusually when others show anger, distress, or affection\n\n\u2022\t\nFail or be slow to respond to their name or other verbal attempts to gain their attention\n\n\u2022\t\nHave difficulties with the back and forth of conversations\n\n\u2022\t\nOften talk at length about a favorite subject but won\u2019t allow anyone else a chance to respond or notice when others react indifferently\n\n\u2022\t\nRepeat words or phrases that they hear, a behavior called echolalia\n\n\u2022\t\nUse words that seem odd, out of place, or have a special  meaning known only to those familiar with that person\u2019s way  of communicating\n\n\u2022\t\nHave facial expressions, movements, and gestures that do not match what they are saying \n\n\u2022\t\nHave an unusual tone of voice that may sound sing-song or flat and robot-like\n\n\u2022\t\nHave trouble understanding another person\u2019s point of view, leaving him or her unable to predict or understand other people\u2019s actions\n\n\n\nPeople with ASD may have other difficulties, such as sensory sensitivity (being sensitive to light, noise, textures of clothing, or temperature), sleep pr oblems, digestion problems, and irritability.\nPeople with ASD can also have many strengths and abilities. For instance, people with ASD may:\n\u2022\t\nHave above-average intelligence\n\n\u2022\t\nBe able to learn things in detail and remember information for long periods of time\n\n\u2022\t\nBe strong visual and auditory learners \n\n\u2022\t\nExcel in math, science, music, and art  \n\n\nNOTICING ASD IN YOUNG CHILDREN \nSome babies with ASD may seem different very early in their development. Others may seem to develop typically until the second or even third year of life, but then parents start to see problems. Learn more about developmental milestones that young children should reach at www.cdc.gov\/ncbddd\/actearly\/milestones.\n\nHow is ASD diagnosed?  \nDoctors diagnose ASD by looking at a child\u2019s behavior and development. Young children with ASD can usually be reliably diagnosed by age 2. \nOlder children and adolescents should be screened for ASD when a parent or teacher raises concerns based on observations of the child\u2019s social, communicative, and play behaviors.   \nDiagnosing ASD in adults is not easy. In adults, some ASD symptoms can overlap with symptoms of other mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, getting a correct diagnosis of ASD as an adult can help a person understand past difficulties, identify his or her strengths, and obtain the right kind of help.  \nDiagnosis in Young Children\nDiagnosis in young children is often a two-stage process: \nGeneral Developmental Screening During Well-Child Checkups \nEvery child should receive well-child check-ups with a pediatrician or an early childhood health care provider. Specific ASD screening should be done at the 18- and 24-month visits.\nEarlier screening might be needed if a child is at high risk for ASD or developmental problems. Those at high risk include those who:\n\u2022\t\nHave a sister, brother, or other family member with ASD\n\n\u2022\t\nHave some ASD behaviors\n\n\u2022\t\nWere born premature, or early, and at a low birth weight\n\n\nParents\u2019 experiences and concerns are very important in the screening process for young children. Sometimes the doctor will ask parents questions about the child\u2019s behaviors and combine this information with his or her observations of the child. Read more about screening instruments at www.cdc.gov\/ncbddd\/autism\/hcp-screening.html.\nChildren who show some developmental problems during this screening process will be referred for another stage of evaluation.\nAdditional Evaluation\nThis evaluation is with a team of doctors and other health professionals with a wide range of specialties who are experienced in diagnosing ASD. This team may include:\n\u2022\t\nA developmental pediatrician\u2014a doctor who has special training in child development\n\n\u2022\t\nA child psychologist and\/or child psychiatrist\u2014a doctor who knows about brain development and behavior\n\n\u2022\t\nA speech-language pathologist\u2014a health professional who has special training in communication difficulties  \n\n\n\nThe evaluation may assess:\n\u2022\t\nCognitive level or thinking skills\n\n\u2022\t\nLanguage abilities\n\n\u2022\t\nAge-appropriate skills needed to complete daily activities independently, such as eating, dressing, and toileting\n\n\nBecause ASD is a complex disorder that sometimes occurs along with other illnesses or learning disorders, the comprehensive evaluation may include: \n\u2022\t\nBlood tests\n\n\u2022\t\nA hearing test\n\n\nThe outcome of the evaluation will result in recommendations to help plan for treatment. \nDiagnosis in Older Children and Adolescents\nOlder children who begin showing symptoms of ASD after starting school are often first recognized and evaluated by the school\u2019s special education team and can be referred to a health care professional. Parents may talk with their child\u2019s pediatrician about their child\u2019s difficulties with social interaction, including problems with subtle communication, such as understanding tone of voice or facial expressions, body language, and lack of understanding of figures of speech, humor, or sarcasm. Parents may also find that their child has trouble forming friendships with peers. At this point, the pediatrician or a child psychologist or psychiatrist who has expertise in ASD can screen the child and refer the family for further evaluation and treatment. \nDiagnosis in Adults\nAdults who notice the signs and symptoms of ASD should talk with a doctor and ask for a referral for an ASD evaluation. While testing for ASD in adults is still being refined, adults can be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist with ASD expertise. The expert will ask about concerns, such as social interaction and communication challenges, sensory issues, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Information about the adult\u2019s developmental history will help in making an accurate diagnosis, so an ASD evaluation may include talking with parents or other family members.\nLearn the signs and ask for help if you\u2019re concerned. \n\nFemale doctor holding stethoscope on baby\u2019s back. \nWhat are the treatments for ASD?\nTreating ASD early and getting proper care can reduce a person\u2019s difficulties and increase his or her ability to maximize strengths and learn new skills. While there is no single best treatment for ASD, working closely with the doctor is an important part of finding the right treatment program.\nMedications\nThere are a few classes of medications that doctors may use to treat some difficulties that are common with ASD. With medication, a person with ASD may have fewer problems with:\n\u2022\t\nIrritability\n\n\u2022\t\nAggression\n\n\u2022\t\nRepetitive behaviors\n\n\u2022\t\nHyperactivity\n\n\u2022\t\nAttention problems\n\n\u2022\t\nAnxiety and depression\n\n\nRead more about the latest news and information on medication warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications at the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) website at www.fda.gov.\nWho is affected by ASD?\nASD affects many people, and it has become more commonly diagnosed in recent years. More boys than girls receive an ASD diagnosis. \n\nWhat causes ASD?\nScientists don\u2019t know the exact causes of ASD, but research suggests that genes and environment play important roles. \n\u2022\t\nResearchers are starting to identify genes that may increase the risk for ASD. \n\n\u2022\t\nASD occurs more often in people who have certain genetic conditions, such as Fragile X syndrome or tuberous sclerosis. \n\n\u2022\t\nMany researchers are focusing on how genes interact with each other and with environmental factors, such as family medical conditions, parental age and other demographic factors, and complications during birth or pregnancy.\n\n\u2022\t\nCurrently, no scientific studies have linked ASD and vaccines.<\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q425","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Left hand holding piece of jigsaw puzzle with several pieces floating above hand in background.

Most of all, quitting can save your life and the lives of others around you.\nNo matter how much or how long you\u2019ve smoked, when you quit smoking, your risk of heart disease and stroke starts to drop.

When you feel an urge to have \u201cjust one,\u201d stop yourself. Think of what triggered the urge, and find a different way to handle it. For example, if you feel nervous and think you need a cigarette, take a walk to calm down instead.\n\u2022  Be prepared for times when you\u2019ll get the urge. If you smoke when drinking, cut down on alcohol so you don\u2019t weaken your promise to yourself.\n\u2022  Change your habits. Instead of having a cigarette after dinner, brush your teeth or walk the dog.\n\u2022  Go where smoking isn\u2019t allowed. In restaurants ask to be seated in the nonsmoking section.\n\u2022  Stay around people who don\u2019t smoke. Ask for support and find a buddy you can call when you feel weak. Tell others they can help you by not giving you a cigarette and by being supportive.\n\u2022  Reward yourself each time you get through a day or week without smoking. Treat yourself to a movie. Or figure out how much money you\u2019ve saved and buy yourself something special.\n\u2022  Talk to your healthcare provider. Counseling, support groups, and medications might help you stop smoking and succeed in becoming a non-smoker.\nHow can I relax?\n\u2022  Try deep breathing. Take a long, deep breath, count to 10 and release it slowly. Repeat five times and you\u2019ll feel much more relaxed.\n\u2022  Allow 20 minutes a day to let go of tension this way: Close your eyes, relax your muscles and think hard about one word, like \u201ccalm.\u201d Say it until you reach a state of relaxation.\n\u2022  Think positive thoughts! Focus on how great it is that you\u2019ve stopped smoking, how food tastes better and how nice it is not to wake up coughing. Remind yourself how smoking stinks, stains your teeth and gives you bad breath.\n\u2022  Listen to relaxation CD\u2019s.\nHow can physical activity help?\n\u2022  It releases stress and calms you.\n\u2022  It can improve your mood and help you think clearer.\n\u2022  It keeps your mind off cigarettes and can help manage urges to smoke.\n\u2022  It can help control your appetite.\n\u2022  It can help you reach and maintain a healthy weight.\n\u2022  It can lower your blood pressure level.\n\u2022  It can increase your HDL (good) cholesterol level.\n\u2022  It can help reduce your risk of developing heart disease and stroke.\n\u2022  It can help control blood sugar by improving how your body uses insulin.\n\nANSWERS \nby heart\n\nHow Can I Handle the Stress of Not Smoking?\n\n\n\nDo you have questions for the doctor or nurse?\n\nHOW CAN I LEARN MORE?\n\nMy Questions:\n\nCall 1-800-AHA-USA1 \n(1-800-242-8721), or visit heart.org \nto learn more about heart disease and stroke.\nSign up to get Heart Insight, a free magazine for heart patients and their families, at heartinsight.org. \nConnect with others sharing similar journeys with heart disease and stroke by joining our Support Network at heart.org\/supportnetwork. \n\nTake a few minutes to write your questions for the next time you see your healthcare provider.\nFor example:\n\nHow long will the cravings last?\nWhat about nicotine gum or a nicotine patch?\n\n\nWe have many other fact sheets to help you make healthier choices to reduce your risk, manage disease or care for a loved one.

Hence, the habitus is, by definition, isomorphic with the structural conditions in which it emerged.The concept of habitus has been used as early as Aristotle but in contemporary usage was introduced by Marcel Mauss and later re-elaborated by Pierre Bourdieu.Origin of concept.Mauss defined habitus as those aspects of culture that are anchored in the body or daily practices of individuals, groups, societies, and nations. It includes the totality of learned habits, bodily skills, styles, tastes, and other non-discursive knowledges that might be said to \"go without saying\" for a specific group -- in that way it can be said to operate beneath the level of rational ideology.Habitus in Bourdieu's social theory.Bourdieu re-elaborated the concept of habitus from Marcel Mauss and extended the scope of the term to include a person's beliefs and dispositions. He used it, in a more or less systematic way, in an attempt to resolve a prominent antinomy of the human sciences: objectivism and subjectivism.The habitus provides the practical skills and dispositions necessary to navigate within different fields (such as sports, professional life, art) and guides the choices of the individual without ever being strictly reducible to prescribed, formal rules. At the same time, the habitus is constantly remade by these navigations and choices (including the success or failure of previous actions).Defenders of Bourdieu argue that such critics have misunderstood and exaggerated the conservative extent of \"habitus\" in Bourdieu. Bourdieu allows agency its location within the bounded structures of society and self. And, Bourdieu advocates a method for researchers to include diverse cultural voices in their work.Body Habitus.Body habitus is the medical term for physique, and is defined as either endomorphic (overweight), ectomorphic (underweight) or mesomorphic (normal weight). In this sense, habitus can be understood as the physical and constitutional characteristics of an individual, especially as related to the tendency to develop a certain disease.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q142","QuestionID":"QID142"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID333","SecondaryAttribute":"Little Chip knew everyone was busy gathering food because:","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e031180-fb40-3180-7b09-3388776e5448\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Little Chip knew everyone was busy gathering food because:<\/span><\/span>","DataExportTag":"Q333","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Little Chip knew everyone was busy gathering food because:","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Winter is coming"},"2":{"Display":"A party was happening"},"3":{"Display":"Relatives were coming over"},"4":{"Display":"They wanted t ofarm"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3,4],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID333"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID207","SecondaryAttribute":"Lower Houses contains all of \u00a0the following features EXCEPT:","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e031180-fb0f-cbfe-554f-19b25b340a55\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Lower Houses contains all of &nbsp;the following features EXCEPT:<\/span><\/span>","DataExportTag":"Q207","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Lower Houses contains all of \u00a0the following features EXCEPT:","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Each have four floors"},"2":{"Display":"They have wider floor with each level"},"3":{"Display":"Each level has a kitchen"},"4":{"Display":"They have larger common rooms"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3,4],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID207","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID270","SecondaryAttribute":"Madeline Amy Sweeney.Flight 11.On September 11, Amy Sweeney was asked by American Airlines to tak...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Madeline Amy Sweeney.Flight 11.On September 11, Amy Sweeney was asked by American Airlines to take an extra shift, because the other crew member who was assigned to the position was ill.

However, Malcolm himself gained no reputation for piety. With the notable exception of Dunfermline Abbey he is not definitely associated with major religious establishments or ecclesiastical reforms.Background.According to an alternative version, Malcolm's mother took both sons into exile at the court of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney, an enemy of Macbeth's family, and perhaps Duncan's kinsman by marriage.Malcolm and Ingibiorg.If the Orderic Vitalis is to be relied upon, one of Malcolm's earliest actions as King may have been to travel south to the court of Edward the Confessor in 1059 to arrange a marriage with Edward's kinswoman Margaret, who had arrived in England two years before from Hungary. If he did visit the English court, he was the first reigning King of Scots to do so in more than eighty years. If a marriage agreement was made in 1059, however, it was not kept, and this may explain the Scots invasion of Northumbria in 1061 when Lindisfarne was plundered. Equally, Malcolm's raids in Northumbria may have been related to the disputed \"Kingdom of the Cumbrians\", reestablished by Earl Siward in 1054, which was under Malcolm's control by 1070.Malcolm's marriage to Ingibiorg secured him peace in the north and west. The \"Heimskringla\" tells that her father Finn had been an adviser to Harald Hardraade and, after falling out with Harald, was then made an Earl by Sweyn Estridsson, King of Denmark, which may have been another recommendation for the match. Malcolm enjoyed a peaceful relationship with the Earldom of Orkney, ruled jointly by his stepsons, Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson. The \"Orkneyinga Saga\" reports strife with Norway but this is probably misplaced as it associates this with Magnus Barefoot, who became king of Norway only in 1093, the year of Malcolm's death.Malcolm and Margaret.In 1069 the exiles returned to England, to join a spreading revolt in the north. Even though Gospatric and Siward's son Waltheof submitted by the end of the year, the arrival of a Danish army under Sweyn Estridsson seemed to ensure that William's position remained weak. Malcolm decided on war, and took his army south into Cumbria and across the Pennines, wasting Teesdale and Cleveland then marching north, loaded with loot, to Wearmouth. There Malcolm met Edgar and his family, who were invited to return with him, but did not. As Sweyn had by now been bought off with a large Danegeld, Malcolm took his army home. In reprisal, William sent Gospatric to raid Scotland through Cumbria. In return, the Scots fleet raided the Northumbrian coast where Gospatric's possessions were concentrated. Late in the year, perhaps shipwrecked on their way to a European exile, Edgar and his family again arrived in Scotland, this time to remain. By the end of 1070, Malcolm had married Edgar's sister Margaret, the future Saint Margaret of Scotland.In 1072, with the Harrying of the North completed and his position again secure, William of Normandy came north with an army and a fleet. Malcolm met William at Abernethy and, in the words of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle \"became his man\" and handed over his eldest son Duncan as a hostage and arranged peace between William and Edgar. Accepting the overlordship of the king of the English was no novelty, previous kings had done so without result. The same was true of Malcolm; his agreement with the English king was followed by further raids into Northumbria, which led to further trouble in the earldom and the killing of Bishop William Walcher at Gateshead. In 1080, William sent his son Robert Curthose north with an army while his brother Odo punished the Northumbrians. Malcolm again made peace, and this time kept it for over a decade.Malcolm and William Rufus.In 1092, the peace began to break down. Based on the idea that the Scots controlled much of modern Cumbria, it had been supposed that William Rufus's new castle at Carlisle and his settlement of English peasants in the surrounds was the cause. However, it is unlikely that Malcolm did control Cumbria, and the dispute instead concerned the estates granted to Malcolm by William Rufus's father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting England. Malcolm sent messengers to discuss the question and William Rufus agreed to a meeting. Malcolm travelled south to Gloucester, stopping at Wilton Abbey to visit his daughter Edith and sister-in-law Cristina. Malcolm arrived there on 24 August 1093 to find that William Rufus refused to negotiate, insisting that the dispute be judged by the English barons. This Malcolm refused to accept, and returned immediately to Scotland.Death.Malcolm's body was taken to Tynemouth Priory for burial, where it remains to this day. A body of a local farmer was sent north for burial in Dunfermline Abbey in the reign of his son Alexander or perhaps on Iona.On 19 June 1250, following the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred and placed in a reliquary. Tradition has it that as the reliquary was carried to the high altar of Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm's grave, it became too heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.Depictions in fiction.Malcolm's accession to the throne, as modified by tradition, is the climax (and finale) of \"Macbeth\" by William Shakespeare. An imaginary version of Malcom's reign is portrayed in the modern sequels \"The Tragedy of Macbeth Part II\" by Noah Lukeman and \"Dunsinane\" by David Greig.Ancestry.Ancestors of Malcolm III of Scotland<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q274","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Malcolm III of Scotland.Malcolm's second wife, Saint Margaret of Scotland, was later beatified an...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID274"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID257","SecondaryAttribute":"Miami Dolphins.The Miami Dolphins are a professional football team based in the Miami, Florida me...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Miami Dolphins.The Miami Dolphins are a professional football team based in the Miami, Florida metropolitan area. They play home games at Sun Life Stadium, in the suburb of Miami Gardens. They are headquartered at the Miami Dolphins Training Facility in Davie, Florida. The Dolphins belong to the Eastern Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Dolphins were founded by Joseph Robbie, and began play in the American Football League as an expansion team in 1966, an example of that seminal league's expanding the sport to areas that were not then represented. Miami joined the NFL as part of the AFL-NFL merger. The Dolphins are the oldest continuous major-league professional sports franchise in the state of Florida. (The first Florida sports franchise was the Miami Seahawks of the AAFC in 1946.)The team made its first Super Bowl appearance following the 1971 season in Super Bowl VI, but lost to the Dallas Cowboys. In 1972, the Dolphins completed the NFL's first and only perfect season culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 regular season games, two playoff games and Super Bowl VII. The achievement became the fourth pro football team to accomplish the feat along with the 1937 Los Angeles Bulldogs (16-0-0, AFL), the 1948 Calgary Stampeders (14-0-0, CFL) and the 1948 Cleveland Browns (15-0-0, AAFC).The 1972 Dolphins held the fourth perfect regular season in NFL history, but the other three teams were beaten in the NFL Championship game. The team also won Super Bowl VIII, becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (first AFL\/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX, losing both games.For most of their history, the Dolphins were coached by Don Shula, the most successful head coach in professional football history. His Dolphins teams posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons with the club. Six future Hall of Fame members played for Miami during the 1970s, including running back Larry Csonka and quarterback Bob Griese. During the 1980s and 1990s quarterback Dan Marino became the most prolific passer in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. He led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances and Super Bowl XIX before retiring after the 1999 season.History.Miami joined the American Football League (AFL) when an expansion team franchise and was awarded to lawyer Joseph Robbie and actor Danny Thomas in 1965 for $7.5 million dollars, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie. A contest was held in 1965 to find the name of the new Miami franchise for the American Football League. A total of 19,843 entries were submitted with over a thousand different names. A dozen finalists were screened through by a seven-member committee made up of the local media, names considered included the Mariners, Marauders, Mustangs, Missiles, Moons, Sharks, and Suns. The winning name, \"Dolphins,\" was submitted by 622 entrants. Mrs. Robert Swanson of West Miami won lifetime passes to Dolphin games when her nickname entry successfully predicted the winner and score of the 1965 football game between Notre Dame and the University of Miami, a scoreless tie.1970s.Before the 1972 Dolphins, only the Chicago Bears, in 1934 and 1942, had finished an NFL regular season with no losses or ties. The 1934 team lost the NFL Championship Game that year to the New York Football Giants, and the 1942 team lost the Championship to the Redskins. The Cleveland Browns were undefeated in the 1948 All-America Football Conference season.1980s.Killer B's.1992.1995.Miami had a solid 10-6 season in 1998 with a career season for receiver O.J. McDuffie, but it was not enough to get past the New York Jets into first place in the division. The Dolphins beat the Bills in the Wild Card round, but lost in the next round to the eventual champion Denver Broncos. (The Broncos lost only two regular season games in 1998, one of which was to the Dolphins.)1999.In 1999, the team advanced to the playoffs at 9-7. After a close win at Seattle in the Wild Card round 20-17, they suffered the second worst playoff loss in NFL history against the Jacksonville Jaguars: 62-7. Noteworthy, in the 1940 NFL Championship game, the Chicago Bears beat the host Washington Redskins 73-0 for the worst playoff game in history. After the season, Jimmy Johnson left the team and Marino retired.2002.2003.2004.On January 3, 2007, Saban announced that he had accepted a contract for eight years and a guaranteed $32 million to coach at the University of Alabama. Saban left despite making several public statements in the preceding weeks assuring fans and owner Wayne Huizenga that he would be staying on as coach of the Dolphins. Cam Cameron, previously the offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers, was then introduced as the new head coach of the Dolphins.2007.The Dolphins began their season with Trent Green as their starting quarterback but after four games, Green was put on the injured reserve. For the rest of the way, the Dolphins went with Cleo Lemon and rookie John Beck as their quarterbacks. The Dolphins also suffered another setback with then NFL leading rusher Ronnie Brown went down for the season with a knee injury.2008.Late in the 2007 season, two-time Super Bowl winning coach Bill Parcells was named Executive Vice President of the Dolphins football operations. Shortly after the season finale, Parcells fired general manager Randy Mueller and on January 3, 2008, head coach Cam Cameron was fired along with almost all of his staff. That same offseason, the Dolphins also parted ways with two Pro Bowlers and long-time Dolphins, releasing linebacker Zach Thomas (who later signed with the Dallas Cowboys) and trading defensive end Jason Taylor to the Washington Redskins for a second round draft pick.Parcells then proceeded to hire Tony Sparano, who was previously an assistant under Parcells during his days as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. The Dolphins ultimately took Jake Long, star offensive lineman out of the University of Michigan with the first pick of the 2008 draft and drafted quarterback Chad Henne with their second round pick (the second consecutive year they drafted a QB in the second round). After the New York Jets traded for Brett Favre and released quarterback Chad Pennington the same day, the Dolphins quickly signed Pennington, who was a former Parcells draft pick.2009.On March 25, 2009 ESPN reporter Chris Mortensen reported that the Dolphins intend to have Chad Henne as the starting quarterback by the 2010 season. That leaves current starting quarterback Chad Pennington's future with the team in doubt after the 2009 season. Henne will receive at least 12 quarters of play in the 2009 preseason to prepare him for the 2010 season.Stadiums.The Dolphins originally played at all of their home games in the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. After the 1986 season, they moved to Joe Robbie Stadium. Later the stadium's name was changed to Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, LandShark Stadium, and, as of January 2010, Sun Life Stadium. The facility is located in Miami Gardens, a suburb of Miami located approximately fifteen miles north of downtown Miami.Training.According to a local newspaper, St. Petersburg Beach hosted the Dolphins very first training camp in 1966. The players were housed next to Sea World.The Dolphins trained at Biscayne College, later renamed St. Thomas University, from 1970 until 1993.In 1993, the Dolphins opened the Miami Dolphins Training Facility at Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida. In 2006, the facility added a domed field which allows the team to practice during thunderstorms which are frequent during summer training camps.Logos and uniforms.The Dolphins logo and uniforms have remained essentially the same since the team's founding. The team's colors are aqua and orange; navy was added as a trim color in 1997. The logo consists of a flaming hoop (or, sunburst) with a leaping dolphin wearing a football helmet bearing the letter M. At their debut in 1966, the dolphin's head was near the center of the sunburst. By 1974, the dolphin's body was centered on the sunburst. The most substantial revision took place in 1997: the sunburst was simplified and the dolphin was darkened and given a more serious game-face expression.The uniform features white helmets with either white or aqua jerseys and either white or aqua pants. The pants are composed of a high grade cotton\/lycra polymer. The most substantial revisions took place in 1997. Navy was introduced as a trim color. The logo was reworked to make the dolphin appear proportionally larger and more three-dimensional in effect. The hashmarks around the perimeters of the logo's sunburst were removed. Navy drop shadows were added to the uniform numbers. The new road uniform featured aqua rather than white pants. The Dolphins made a cameo appearance in.For much of their history the Dolphins have worn their white jerseys at home for daytime games, thus forcing their opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys in the humid weather that is typical of South Florida for most of the year. The aqua home jerseys are typically worn for night games. The Dolphins began this tradition during the perfect season of 1972 and have continued it ever since. Aqua jerseys are also sometimes worn for road games against the other two teams known for wear San Diego Chargers, or other teams who choose to wear white at home in the early season. Miami and Dallas are the only NFL teams that wear white jerseys throughout the season. Washington only wears white for the first half of the season.In 2003 the Dolphins introduced an alternate orange jersey worn once each season for home night contests in 2003 and 2004. They recorded wins both times, against Washington in 2003 and New England in 2004. The alternate jersey was worn again on Monday Night Football against the New York Jets on October 12, 2009.The Dolphins also won this game, 31-27.On three occasions the Dolphins have worn an all-aqua combination for prime-time games: a win over the Chicago Bears in 2002, a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2003, and a win over the Cleveland Browns in 2004.For 2008 the navy blue drop shadow on the uniform numbers were thinned in order to make them easier to read. Despite rumors, the Dolphins have no plans to change the logo.Fight song.The Dolphins fight song is played once at every home game at the end of the third quarter. The song was written and composed by Lee Ofman. Ofman approached the Dolphins with it before the 1972 season because he wanted music to inspire his favorite team. The fight song would soon serve as a good luck charm for the Dolphins that season. The Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to record an undefeated season, going 17-0 en route to victory over the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII. The following season, Miami posted an equally impressive 15-2 record, and capped the season with another title, defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII. The back-to-back championship runs, coupled with the popularity of the fight song amongst Dolphins fans, have ensured the song's longevity. The Dolphins revealed a new fight song by T-Pain &amp; Jimmy Buffett featuring Pitbull on August 7, 2009 which will be introduced for the '09\/10 NFL season. The fight song was played during the preseason home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2009, but was not played during the second preseason game against the Carolina Panthers on August 22, 2009 after being booed heavily in the first game. Furthermore, the team has preferred to play Buffett's song \"Fins\" after scores during the 2009 regular season instead of the traditional fight song. The Dolphins shorthand nickname, \"The Fins,\" has been recognized and used by the team.Cheerleaders.The team's cheerleaders are known collectively as the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders. The company had its debut in 1978 as the Dolphins Starbrites. (The name referred to the co-sponsor, Starbrite Car Polish.) The cheerleaders' founding choreographer was June Taylor, famed colleague of Jackie Gleason, who led the squad until her retirement in 1990.The Dolphin Dolls, a 125-member pep squad of girls aged 8 to 18, cheered the team at home games from 1966 to 1977.T.D..On Friday, April 18, 1997, the first \"official\" mascot of the Miami Dolphins was introduced. The 7 foot mascot made his public debut on April 19 at Pro Player Stadium during the team's draft day party. The team then made a \"Name the Mascot\" contest that drew over 13,000 enteries covering all 50 states and 22 countries. 529 names were suggested. The winning entry, was announced at the annual Dolphins Awards Banquet on June 4, 1997.Dolfan Denny.Flipper.From 1966 to 1968 a live dolphin who was situated in a fish tank in the open (east) end of the Orange Bowl. He would jump in the tank and celebrate touchdowns and field goals. Flipper was removed from the Orange Bowl after 1968 in order to save costs. In \"Ace Ventura\", a live dolphin who did tricks after the Dolphins scored a touchdown named Snowflake was the basis of the film after he is kidnapped as part of a revenge plot against Dan Marino.Pro Football Hall of Famers.Each of these players is honored with a placard on the facing of the upper level of one end zone at Sun Life Stadium. So is team founder-owner Joe Robbie, who has not yet been elected to the Hall of Fame. In place of a uniform number, Shula has the number 347, representing his record number of NFL coaching victories, 274 of them as Dolphins head coach.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q257","QuestionID":"QID257","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Miami Dolphins.The Miami Dolphins are a professional football team based in the Miami, Florida me...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[]}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID337","SecondaryAttribute":"Mrs. Hudson read a book about:","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e031180-fb41-2587-1463-9607620c71bb\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Mrs. Hudson read a book about:<\/span><\/span>","DataExportTag":"Q337","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Mrs. Hudson read a book about:","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"A mystery"},"2":{"Display":"Friendship"},"3":{"Display":"An adventure"},"4":{"Display":"Animals"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3,4],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID337"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID261","SecondaryAttribute":"Multiple inheritance.Multiple inheritance refers to a feature of some object-oriented programming...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Multiple inheritance.Multiple inheritance refers to a feature of some object-oriented programming languages in which a class can inherit behaviors and features from more than one superclass.

Children also \nmay have them. \n\nTreatment is available for people with anxiety disorders. Researchers \nare also looking for new treatments that will help relieve symptoms. \n\nThis booklet is about one kind of anxiety disorder called social phobia. \nSome people also call it social anxiety disorder. For information about \nother kinds of anxiety disorders, please see the end of this booklet. \n\n\n\nSocial Phobia \nSocial phobia is a strong fear of being judged by others and of being embarrassed. This fear can be so strong that it gets in the way of going to work or school or doing other everyday things. \nPeople with social phobia are afraid of doing common things in front of other people; for example, they might be afraid to sign a check in front of a cashier at the grocery store, or they might be afraid to eat or drink in front of other people. All of us have been a little bit nervous, at one time or another, about things like meeting new people or giving a speech. But people with social phobia worry about these and other things for weeks before they happen. \nMost of the people who have social phobia know that they shouldn\u2019t be as afraid as they are, but they can\u2019t control their fear. Sometimes, they end up staying away from places or events where they think they might have to do something that will embarrass them. That can keep them from doing the everyday tasks of living and from enjoying times with family and friends. \nMost people who have social phobia \nknow they shouldn't be as afraid \nas they are, but they can't control \ntheir f ear. \nThis is a list of common symptoms. \n\nPeople with social phobia: \n\u2022 \t\nare very anxious about being with other people. \n\n\u2022 \t\nare very self-conscious in front of other people; that is, they are very worried about how they themselves will act. \n\n\n\u2022 \tare very afraid of being embarrassed in front of other people. \n\u2022 \t\nare very afraid that other people will judge them. \n\n\u2022 \t\nworry for days or weeks before an event where other people will be. \n\n\u2022 \t\nstay away from places where there are other people. \n\n\u2022 \t\nhave a hard time making friends and keeping friends. \n\n\u2022 \t\nmay have body symptoms when they are with other people, such as: \n\n\nblushing, \nheavy sweating, \ntrembling, \nnausea, and \nhaving a hard time talking. \n\n\nWhen does social phobia start? \nSocial phobia usually starts during the child or teen years, usually at about age 13. A doctor can tell that a person has social phobia if the person has had symptoms for at least six months. Without treatment, social phobia can last for many years or a lifetime. \n\nIs there help? \nThere is help for people with social phobia. The first step is to go to a doctor or health clinic to talk about symptoms. People who think they have social phobia may want to bring this booklet to the doctor to help them talk about the symptoms in it. The doctor will do an exam to make sure that another physical problem isn\u2019t causing the symptoms. The doctor may make a referral to a mental health specialist. \nDoctors may prescribe medication to help relieve social phobia. It\u2019s important to know that some of these medicines may take a few weeks to start working. In most states only a medical doctor (a family doctor or psychiatrist) can prescribe medications. \nTreatment can help people with \nsocial phobia f eel less anxious \nand f earful. \nThe kinds of medicines used to treat social phobia are listed below. Some of these medicines are used to treat other problems, such as depression, but also are helpful for social phobia: \n\u2022 \nantidepressants, \n\n\u2022 \nanti-anxiety medicines, and \n\n\u2022 \nbeta blockers. \n\n\nDoctors also may ask people with social phobia to go to therapy with a licensed social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist. This treatment can help people with social phobia feel less anxious and fearful. \nThere is no cure for social phobia yet, but treatments can give relief to people who have it and help them live a more normal life. If you know someone with signs of social phobia, talk to him or her about seeing a doctor. Offer to go along for support. \nTo find out more about social phobia, call 1-866-615-NIMH (1-866-615-6464) to have free information mailed to you. \n\nWho pays for treatment? \nMost insurance plans cover treatment for anxiety disorders. People who are going to have treatment should check with their own insurance companies to find out about coverage. For people who don\u2019t have insurance, local city or county governments may offer treatment at a clinic or health center, where the cost is based on income. Medicaid plans also may pay for social phobia treatment. \n\nWhy do people get social phobia? \nSocial phobia sometimes runs in families, but no one knows for sure why some people have it, while others don\u2019t. When chemicals in the brain are not at a certain level it can cause a person to have social phobia. That is why medications often help with the symptoms because they help the brain chemicals stay at the correct levels. \nTo improve treatment, scientists are studying how well different medicines and therapies work. In one kind of research, people with social phobia choose to take part in a clinical trial to help doctors find out what treatments work best for most people, or what works best for different symptoms. Usually, the treatment is free. Scientists are learning more about how the brain works so that they can discover new treatments.<\/span><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q502","QuestionID":"QID502","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"National Institute of Mental Health Social Phobia Anxiety Disorders People with anxiety disorders...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[]}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID521","SecondaryAttribute":"Now that youve read about the basics, there are a few more things you should learn.

The epidemiology of AIDS or global warming require understanding of diverse disciplines to solve neglected problems. \"Interdisciplinary\" may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions, for example, women's studies or ethnic area studies.The adjective interdisciplinary is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand, including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines. For example, the subject of land use may appear differently when examined by different disciplines, for instance, biology, chemistry, economics, geography, and politics.Development.Interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise from a shared conviction that the traditional disciplines are unable or unwilling to address an important problem. For example, social science disciplines such as anthropology and sociology paid little attention to the social analysis of technology throughout most of the twentieth century. As a result, many social scientists with interests in technology have joined science and technology studies programs, which are typically staffed by scholars drawn from numerous disciplines. They may also arise from new research developments, such as nanotechnology, which cannot be addressed without combining the approaches of two or more disciplines. Examples include quantum information processing, an amalgamation of quantum physics and computer science, and bioinformatics, combining molecular biology with computer science. Some institutions of higher education offer accredited degree programs in Interdisciplinary Studies. Norfolk State University, a historically black institution located in Norfolk, VA, is one such example of this.Barriers.Because most participants in interdisciplinary ventures were trained in traditional disciplines, they must learn to appreciate differing perspectives and methods. For example, a discipline that places more emphasis on quantitative \"rigor\" may produce practitioners who think of themselves (and their discipline) as \"more scientific\" than others; in turn, colleagues in \"softer\" disciplines may associate quantitative approaches with an inability to grasp the broader dimensions of a problem. An interdisciplinary program may not succeed if its members remain stuck in their disciplines (and in disciplinary attitudes).From the disciplinary perspective, much interdisciplinary work may be seen as \"soft,\" lacking in rigor, or ideologically motivated; these beliefs place barriers in the career paths of those who choose interdisciplinary work. For example, interdisciplinary grant applications are often refereed by peer reviewers drawn from established disciplines; not surprisingly, interdisciplinary researchers may experience difficulty getting funding for their research. In addition, untenured researchers know that, when they seek promotion and tenure, it is likely that some of the evaluators will lack commitment to interdisciplinarity. They may fear that making a commitment to interdisciplinary research will increase the risk of being denied tenure.Interdisciplinary programs may fail if they are not given sufficient autonomy. For example, interdisciplinary faculty are usually recruited to a joint appointment, with responsibilities in both an interdisciplinary program (such as women's studies) and a traditional discipline (such as history). If the traditional discipline makes the tenure decisions, new interdisciplinary faculty will be hesitant to commit themselves fully to interdisciplinary work. Other barriers include the generally disciplinary orientation of most scholarly journals, leading to the perception, if not the fact, that interdisciplinary research is hard to publish. In addition, since traditional budgetary practices at most universities channel resources through the disciplines, it becomes difficult to account for a given scholar or teacher's salary and time. During periods of budgetary retraction, the natural tendency to serve the primary constituency (i.e., students majoring in the traditional discipline) makes resources scarce for teaching and research comparatively far from the center of the discipline as traditionally understood. For these same reasons, the introduction of new interdisciplinary programs is often perceived as a competition for diminishing funds, and may for this reason meet resistance.Due to these and other barriers, interdisciplinary research areas are strongly motivated to become disciplines themselves. If they succeed, they can establish their own research funding programs and make their own tenure and promotion decisions. In so doing, they lower the risk of entry. Examples of former interdisciplinary research areas that have become disciplines include neuroscience, cybernetics, biochemistry and biomedical engineering. These new fields are occasionally referred to as \"interdisciplines.\"Interdisciplinary studies.\"Interdisciplinary studies\" is an academic program or process seeking to synthesize broad perspectives, knowledge, skills, interconnections, and epistemology in an educational setting. Interdisciplinary programs may be founded in order to facilitate the study of subjects which have some coherence, but which cannot be adequately understood from a single disciplinary perspective (for example, women's studies or medieval studies). More rarely, and at a more advanced level, interdisciplinarity may itself become the focus of study, in a critique of institutionalized disciplines' ways of segmenting knowledge.Since 1998 there has been an ascendancy in the value of the concept and practice of interdisciplinary research and teaching and a growth in the number of bachelors degrees awarded at U.S. universities classified as multi- or interdisciplinary studies. The number of interdisciplinary bachelors degrees awarded annually rose from 7,000 in 1973 to 30,000 a year by 2005 according to data from the National Center of Educational Statistics (NECS). In addition, educational leaders from the Boyer Commission to Carnegie's President Vartan Gregorian to Alan Leshner, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science have advocated for interdisciplinary rather than disciplinary approaches to problem solving in the 21st Century. This has been echoed by federal funding agencies, particularly the NIH under the Direction of Elias Zerhouni, who have advocated that grant proposals be framed more as interdisciplinary collaborative projects than single researcher, single discipline ones. At the same time, longstanding bachelors in interdisciplinary studies programs many existing and thriving for 30 or more years, have been closed down, in spite of healthy enrollment. Examples include Arizona International (formerly part of the University of Arizona), The School of Interdisciplinary Studies at Miami University, and the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at Wayne State University; others such as the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at Appalachian State University, and George Mason University's New Century College, have been cut back. Stuart Henry has seen this trend as part of the hegemony of the disciplines in their attempt to recolonize the experimental knowledge production of otherwise marginalized fields of inquiry. This is due to threat perceptions seemingly based on the ascendancy of interdisciplinary studies against traditional academia.Historical examples.There are many examples of when a particular idea, almost on the same period, arises in different disciplines. One case is the shift from the approach of focusing on \"specialized segments of attention\" (adopting one particular perspective), to the idea of \"instant sensory awareness of the whole\", an attention to the \"total field\", a \"sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity\", an \"integral idea of structure and configuration\". This has happened in painting (with cubism), physics, poetry, communication and educational theory. According to Marshall McLuhan, this paradigm shift was due to the passage from an era shaped by mechanization, which brought sequentiality, to the era shaped by the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q154","QuestionID":"QID154"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID94","SecondaryAttribute":"Once upon a time, there was a squirrel named Joey.

However, up to 40% of individuals with PAD have no leg pain. \nSymptoms of pain, ache, or cramp with walking (claudication) can occur in the \nbuttock, hip, thigh, or calf.3 \n\nPhysical signs in the leg that may indicate peripheral arterial disease include muscle \natrophy, hair loss, smooth shiny skin, skin that is cool to the touch especially if \naccompanied by pain while walking (which is relieved by stopping walking), \ndecreased or absent pulses in the feet, non-healing ulcers or sores on the legs or \nfeet, and cold or numb toes.3 4 \n\nPreventing PAD background. \n\n\nPreventing PAD\n\n\u2022 Physical activity and exercise are import for preventing \nPAD and for improving symptoms of PAD.3 \n\n\u2022 Avoid use of tobacco\u2014smoking increases the risk of \nPAD by 2\u20136 times and it worsens the symptoms of PAD.5 \n\n\u2022 Control high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. \n\nSupervised exercise training programs can \nimprove and prolong walking distance in \nindividuals with PAD.\n\n \n\ntwo men walking\nDiagnosis and Treatment of PAD\n\nIn patients with symptoms of PAD, the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a non-invasive \ntest that measures the blood pressure in the ankles and compares it with the blood \npressure in the arms at rest and after exercise. Imaging tests such as ultrasound, \nmagnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomographic (CT) \nangiography can provide additional information in diagnosing PAD.2-4 \n\n\u2022 Individuals with PAD are at risk for developing coronary artery \ndisease and cerebrovascular disease, which could lead to a \nheart attack or stroke.5 \n\n\u2022 Aspirin or other similar anti-platelet medications may prevent \nthe development of serious complications from PAD and \nassociated atherosclerosis.3,5 \n\n\u2022 All efforts must be made to stop smoking. \n\n\u2022 Severe cases may require surgery to bypass blocked arteries. \n\nReferences \n\n1.

At peak time, the locals are very crowded and the men stick out of the doors, climb on top of the roof...<\/div><div>&nbsp;I attend a Coaching Class which is located in Borivali for which I have to cross the Railway Tracks on foot. (Of Course, its illegal but there is no other way, the common bridge is quarter km away) Many people use the crossing to cross over to Borivali W from the Eastern side and Vice Versa,like me.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Its not that I hadnt heard about eve-teasing, I had assumed it to be a minor thing and never bothered to think too much about it. But all that changed last year. As I was waiting for a packed local to pass, with a few other people, I suddenly noticed several jeering voices, hooting and whistling. They were all coming from the local coming from Virar at 9:30 am.. To be honest, I had not expected such a thing to happen, so I was shocked for a moment. Then I saw the girl beside me hanging her head down in Humiliation and the commuters above (all of them, yes all of them) eyeballing her and whistling. What peturbed me the most was that the eve-teaser was not a single person but the entire train. I had to watch with sadness and helplessness as coach after coach passed and all the people inside each coach started howling. Maybe being in a group gave them some feeling of invincibility. I looked at the others nearby. Clearly they were uncomfortable too, trying to avoid looking at the train as much as possible. After the train passed, everyone including the girl went back to their business. I thought maybe they were used to it now.<\/div><div>&nbsp;I was left alone, feeling insecure,weak and helpless. I spent the entire day brooding over the incident.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Now I had to attend my class every alternate day. Whenever there happened to be a female (age didnt matter) the hootings began if she had to wait for the train to pass.A single guy whistled and the entire train followed him. The jeerings and tauntings were especially high if she was in a western outfit (not necessarily immodest, the kind of clothes you would not mind your sister wearing)<\/div><div>&nbsp;Even women aged 40 + were not spared.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Common phrases used were \" Phone me coin Daal\" (for someone using a cellphone) and some other unmentionable phrases.<\/div><div>&nbsp;In the evenings the train used to be relatively empty and I did not find the incidents happening . So obivously they felt safe in numbers.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Once I saw a group of girls (age maybe 13-14) become a victim to this. Yet I could only stand and watch as the train drifted away quickly.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Soon, I noticed the females who regularly crossed the tracks would wait at the street, behind a wall for the train to pass before they stepped on the railway tracks.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Now, I have become so used to this that it does not bother me anymore. I know that I am helpless, I cant do anything to stop it. The train wont stop and even if it would there is no way I can tackle 50-60 people on my own.<\/div><div>&nbsp;I just pray that someday, maybe I wouldnt have to wait for the train to pass with some member of my family.....<\/div><div>&nbsp;What I think is that these people are influenced too much by Indian Movies. In movies, usually the actress falls for cheap antics and cheesy dialogues by the actor.

Can I be cured? What kinds of treatment would be best for me? Will it hurt? How long will treatment take? How much will it cost? How will my life change while I\u2019m being treated and after treatment ends? These are all normal questions for people with cancer. \nThis guide will explain one type of treatment \u2013 radiation therapy \u2013 a little better. We\u2019ll try to help you know what radiation therapy is and what it will be like.  \nIf you have more questions, ask your cancer care team to help you. It\u2019s always best to be open and honest with them. That way, they can help you decide which treatment is best for you. \n\nQuestions about radiation therapy \nWhat is radiation therapy? \nRadiation (RAY-dee-A-shun) therapy (THER-uh-pee) is the use of radiation to treat cancer and other problems. There are different types of radiation. One that you may know about is x-rays. If you\u2019ve ever had an x-ray of your chest or any other body part, you\u2019ve had some radiation. Radiation is used in much higher doses to treat some cancers. \n\nHow does radiation therapy work? \nSpecial equipment sends high doses of radiation to cancer cells or tumors. This kills the cancers cells and keeps them from growing and making more cancer cells. Radiation can also affect normal cells near the tumor. But normal cells can repair themselves \u2013 cancer cells can\u2019t. \nSometimes radiation is the only treatment needed. Other times it\u2019s used along with chemo (KEY-mo) or surgery. \nSometimes radiation can cure cancer. Other times the goal may be to slow the cancer\u2019s growth to help you feel better. Be sure to talk to your cancer care team about the goal of your treatment. \n\nHow much does radiation therapy cost? \nRadiation therapy costs a lot. How much yours costs depends on the type of treatment you get and the number of treatments you need. \nMost health insurance plans cover radiation therapy. Find out who you can talk to about your coverage and how much you\u2019ll have to pay. Try to do this before you start treatment. If your income is low and you can get Medicaid, it will help pay for treatments. \nIf you don\u2019t have insurance or Medicaid, talk with your hospital\u2019s social service office. Or call your American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345 to find out what help there might be for you. \n\n\nWhat should I ask my doctor? \nYour radiation therapy will be planned just for you. Work closely with your cancer care team to decide what\u2019s best for you. Ask the doctor, nurses, and others on your team all the questions you have. They know the most about radiation and how it works. \nBe ready. Write down questions ahead of time. Take them with you, and don\u2019t be afraid to say you need to know more. Nothing you say will sound silly or strange to your team. They know you want to learn as much about radiation as you can. All patients who get radiation have questions. Here are some you might want to ask: \n\u2022 \nWhat kind of radiation do you think will work best for me? \n\n\u2022 \nWhat\u2019s the goal of radiation in my case? \n\n\u2022 \nWill it stop the spread of cancer? \n\n\u2022 \nWill it kill or shrink the tumor? \n\n\u2022 \nHow will we know if the radiation is working? \n\n\u2022 \nIf I\u2019m getting radiation after surgery, will it kill any cancer cells left behind? Could radiation alone be used instead of surgery? \n\n\u2022 \nAre there other ways to treat the cancer? \n\n\u2022 \nHow will I get radiation, how often, and for how long? \n\n\u2022 \nWhat side effects should I watch for? \n\n\u2022 \nWill any of these side effects change my eating, drinking, exercise, work, or sex life? \n\n\u2022 \nWill the treatment or side effects change the way I look? \n\n\u2022 \nHow long might the side effects last? \n\n\u2022 \nWhat\u2019s the chance that the cancer will spread or come back if I get radiation? What\u2019s the chance that the cancer will spread or come back if I don\u2019t get it? \n\n\u2022 \nDoes my insurance cover radiation? If not, how will I pay for it? \n\n\u2022 \nWill I still be able to work (or go to school) during treatment? \n\n\n\nWill I be able to work during treatment? \nSome people work all the way through treatment, and others don\u2019t. Even if you do work, you may need to take some extra time off. It\u2019s good to know about your rights at work and how to keep your health insurance. If you have any questions about work or your insurance, please call your American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345. \nIf you have stopped working, you can go back to your job as soon as you and your doctor believe you\u2019re up to it, even while getting radiation. Make sure you tell your cancer care team what you do each day at work and how it affects your body. If you have to do a lot of lifting or heavy work, you may need to find out if you can change what you do until you get your strength back. Talk with your team or call us if you have questions about going back to work. \n\nHow is radiation given? \nRadiation can be given in 3 ways. They are: \n\u2022 \nExternal beam radiation \n\n\u2022 \nInternal radiation \n\n\u2022 \nSystemic radiation \n\n\nSome people get more than 1 type of radiation. \nExternal beam radiation therapy \nRadiation that comes from outside your body is called external beam radiation. (External means outside.) A big machine sends high-energy beams to the tumor and some of the area around the tumor. \nHow long does the treatment take? \n\nFor most people, treatments are given 5 days a week for 1 to 10 weeks. The number of treatments you need depends on the size and type of cancer, where the cancer is, how healthy you are, and what other treatments you\u2019re getting. Most people get a break on weekends so their normal cells can recover. \n\nWhat happens during each treatment visit? \nExternal radiation therapy is like getting an x-ray. There\u2019s no pain and only takes a few minutes. But it takes time to get the machine set up, so it may take 15 to 30 minutes to get each treatment. It\u2019s often given in a walk-in clinic, so you don\u2019t have to be in the hospital. \nYou\u2019ll lie flat on a treatment table, under the radiation machine. The radiation therapist may put special shields or blocks between the machine and other parts of your body. These protect your other body parts from the radiation. You\u2019ll be asked to stay still during the treatment, but you don\u2019t have to hold your breath. \nOnce you\u2019re all set and the machine is ready, the therapist goes into a nearby room to run the machine. The therapist can see you and talk to you the whole time. While the machine is working, you\u2019ll hear clicking, whirring, and something that sounds like a vacuum cleaner as the machine moves around you to aim the radiation. The radiation therapist controls this movement and checks to make sure the machine is working the way it should. It will not touch you. \nIf you\u2019re worried about anything that happens while the machine is on, talk to the radiation therapist. If you start to feel sick or scared, let the therapist know right away. The machine can be stopped at any time. \n\n\nInternal radiation therapy \nWhen a radiation source is put inside you, it\u2019s called internal radiation therapy. (Internal means inside.) This lets the doctor give a large dose of radiation right to the cancer cells and\/or tumor.  \nThe radioactive source is called an implant. It might look like a wire, pellet, or seeds. The implant is put very near or right into the tumor, and the radiation travels only a very short distance. The implant can be left in place forever or just for a short time. \nHow are implants put in the body? \nSome implants are put in the body with needle-like tubes. This might be done in an operating room, and drugs may be used to make you relax or sleep. \nOther implants are put in a body opening, like the uterus (womb) or rectum. These are only left in for a short time. \n\nSome implants are left in. \nIf you have implants that will be left in your body, you may not be allowed to do some things, such as be close to children or pregnant women, for a certain time. But you can go back to the other normal things you do right away. \nThe implants give off less and less radiation over time. They stop giving off radiation after a few weeks to a few months. Once the radiation is gone, the implants just stay in and cause no harm. \n\nSome implants are taken out. \nSome implants are taken out after they have been in for many hours or days. While the implants are in place, you\u2019ll stay in a private hospital room. Doctors and nurses will take care of you, but they\u2019ll need to limit how much time they spend with you. \nMany times, these implants are taken out right in your hospital room. The treated area may be sore for some time, but most people get back to normal quickly. \n\n\nSystemic radiation therapy \nSystemic (sis-TEM-ick) radiation uses radioactive drugs to treat certain types of cancer. These drugs can be given by mouth or put into a vein; they then travel throughout the body. They collect where the cancer is to give off their radiation and kill the cancer cells. \nSafety issues \nBecause systemic radiation uses a radioactive liquid that goes through your whole body, some radiation will be in your body for a few days until your body has a chance to get rid of it. The radioactive materials can leave your body through saliva, sweat, blood, and urine, making these fluids radioactive. You may need to stay in the hospital for a few days. \nYour cancer care team will tell you what you need to do to be safe until your body no longer contains radiation that might affect others. What you must do depends on the radioactive drug used. Be sure you understand what you need to do to protect the people around you. \n\n\n\nWhat about radiation side effects? \nSome people have no side effects at all, while others do. The most common side effects are: \n\u2022 \nFeeling very tired (fatigue [fuh-TEEG]) \n\n\u2022 \nSkin changes over the treated area \n\n\u2022 \nNot wanting to eat (appetite loss) \n\n\nOther side effects depend on the part of the body being treated. For instance, if you get radiation to your head, you might have hair loss. Or if you get radiation to your chest, you might have a cough or sore throat. \nMost side effects go away in time. But there are ways to help you feel better. If you have bad side effects, the doctor may stop your treatments for a while, change the schedule, or change the type of treatment you\u2019re getting. Tell your cancer care team about any side effects you have so they can help you with them. \nNext we will talk about a few of the more common side effects. \nHow do I deal with fatigue? \nFatigue (fuh-TEEG) means you feel very tired. It can last for a long time and keep you from doing the things you want and need to do. It\u2019s not like the fatigue a person feels at the end of a long, hard day. That kind gets better after a good night\u2019s sleep. The fatigue caused by cancer and\/or cancer treatment is worse and causes more problems. Rest does not always make it go away. \nCancer fatigue is very common. By knowing about fatigue, you can cope with it better. No lab tests or x-rays can show fatigue or tell how bad it is for you. Only you know if you have fatigue and how bad it is.  \nIf you have fatigue, be sure to tell your cancer care team. You can say it\u2019s mild, moderate, or severe. Or, you can use a scale from 0 to 10. A 0 means you have no fatigue, and a 10 means you have the worst fatigue ever. \nThis weak or weary feeling will go away over time after your treatment ends. Until then there are some things you can do to help reduce your fatigue: \n\u2022 \nDo the things that you need to get done when you feel your best. \n\n\u2022 \nAsk for help, and let people help you. \n\n\u2022 \nPut things that you use often within easy reach. \n\n\u2022 \nSet up a daily routine. \n\n\u2022 \nTry to relax to reduce stress. Many people feel better with deep breathing, prayer, \ntalking with others, reading, listening to music, and painting, among other things. \n\n\n\u2022 \nBalance rest and activity. Don\u2019t spend too much time in bed, which can make you weak. Don\u2019t let rest or daytime naps keep you from sleeping at night. A few short rest breaks are better than one long one. \n\n\u2022 \nTalk to your cancer care team about how to keep your pain and nausea \u2013 if you have these \u2013 under control.  \n\n\u2022 \nDepression can make you feel more tired. Talk with your doctor about treatment if you think you may be depressed. Feeling sad or worthless, losing interest in life, thinking about death a lot, or thinking of hurting yourself are some signs of depression. \n\n\u2022 \nGet some exercise each day. Talk to your cancer care team before you start. \n\n\u2022 \nYou may be told to eat a special diet. If so, try to do it. It\u2019s good to include protein (meat, milk, eggs, and beans). It\u2019s also good to drink about 8 to 10 glasses of water a day. \n\n\nLet your cancer care team know about your fatigue and talk with them if: \n\u2022 \nIt doesn\u2019t get better, keeps coming back, or gets worse. \n\n\u2022 \nYou\u2019re more tired than usual during or after an activity. \n\n\u2022 \nYour fatigue doesn\u2019t get better with rest or sleep. \n\n\u2022 \nYou become confused or can\u2019t think. \n\n\u2022 \nYou can\u2019t get out of bed for more than 24 hours. \n\n\u2022 \nYou can\u2019t do the things you need or want to do. \n\n\n\nWhat can I do about skin changes? \nSkin over the part of your body being treated may look red, swollen, blistered, sunburned, or tanned. After a few weeks, your skin may become dry, flaky, itchy, or it may peel. Be sure to let your cancer care team know about any skin changes. They can suggest ways to ease the discomfort, help keep it from getting worse, and try to prevent infection. \nMost skin changes slowly go away after treatment ends. In some cases, though, the treated skin will stay darker and might be more sensitive than it was before. You need to be gentle with your skin. Here are some ways to do this: \n\u2022 \nWear loose clothes made from soft, smooth fabrics.  \n\n\u2022 \nDo not rub, scrub, scratch, or use tape on treated skin. If your skin must be covered or bandaged, use paper tape or other tape for sensitive skin. Try to put the tape outside the treatment area, and don\u2019t put the tape in the same place each time. \n\n\u2022 \nDo not put heat or cold (such as a heating pad, heat lamp, or ice pack) on the treated skin.  \n\n\u2022 \nProtect the treated area from the sun. It may be extra sensitive to sunlight. Protect your skin from the sun even after radiation therapy ends. Wear clothes that cover the skin, or use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. \n\n\u2022 \nUse only lukewarm water and mild soap. Just let water run over the treated area. Do not rub. Also be careful not to rub away the ink marks needed for your radiation therapy until it\u2019s done. \n\n\u2022 \nDo not use a pre-shave or after-shave lotion or hair-removal products. Use an electric shaver if you must shave the area, but first check with your cancer care team. \n\n\u2022 \nAsk your cancer care team before using anything on the skin in the treatment area. This includes powders, creams, perfumes, deodorants, body oils, ointments, lotions, or home remedies while you\u2019re being treated and for several weeks afterward. <\/span><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q471","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Radiation Therapy What It Is, How It Helps What\u2019s in this guide If your doctor has told you that...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID471"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID129","SecondaryAttribute":"Regarding the Lapacian of a scalar field, which are maps?

Many women notice that they put on weight in the years leading to menopause (when menstrual periods end). They may find that losing the extra weight is not easy.\nOverweight and obesity are also major health problems for black women. More than 82 percent of U.S. black women age 20 and older are overweight or obese. And over 58 percent of black women are obese. This brochure is part of a series of materials and program designed to encourage black women to move more and eat better. You may use this brochure and others in the Sisters Together Series to help you and other black women become physically active and make healthy food choices.\nBeing physically active and eating well may help you to stay fit and feel fabulous over the years. If you are overweight or inactive, you may have a higher risk for these health problems:\n..type 2 diabetes (high blood sugar)\n..high blood pressure\n..heart disease\n..stroke\n..certain forms of cancer\nTwo middle-aged women hugging.\nNo matter what your age, you may be able to improve your health if you move more and eat better! This booklet gives you tips on how to get moving and eat well throughout your life.\n\nWhy should I move more and eat better?\nBeing physically active and making healthier food choices are good for you. In addition to improving your physical health, moving more and eating better may also do the following: \n..Reduce stress.\n..Set an example for your family.\nYour family and friends can be great sources of support as you adopt a healthier lifestyle. Ask them to join you in healthy eating and physical activity. Being healthy is important for them, too! By making healthy choices together, you may find it is easier to move more and eat better!\nHow can I add more movement to \nmy daily routine? \nTalk to your health care provider \nYou may have a chronic health problem that makes it difficult to move more in the ways suggested in this brochure. If so, talk to your health care provider about setting your own goals. \nAim to move more for 30 minutes a day \nTry to do at least 30 minutes of moderately intense physical activity on most or all days of the week. Moderately intense activities, like brisk walking or dancing, speed up your heart rate and breathing. Getting 150 total minutes spread over the week is suggested. But even 60 total minutes a week of activity that is moderately intense may bring you health benefits.\nStart with 10 \nFitting in physical activity is not as hard as you may think. You don\u2019t have to do the whole 30 minutes at one time. Start with a 10-minute session three times a day, then move to 15 minutes twice a day. \nStrengthen your muscles \nAlso try to do activities to strengthen your muscles at least two times a week. If you have weights or a rubber exercise band, they are good options to use. You can also lift canned food as weights for strengthening your arms and back. These activities are important because older adults\u2014especially women\u2014tend to lose muscle and bone every year. Activities to strengthen your muscles may help prevent or reduce this loss.\nBattle your barriers \nSeveral reasons may occur to you about why you find being physically active difficult. If some of the thoughts below sound familiar to you, try the tips after each comment to overcome things that may keep you from being active.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for me to get physically active.\u201d\nIt is never too late to start moving more! Physical activity may help you manage your arthritis and osteoporosis (bone loss). Being more active may also help you do the following: \n..Keep your body flexible.\n..Help you to improve your balance.\n..Control high blood sugar, especially if you lose weight.\n..Let you keep living in your own home without help. \nMiddle-aged couple jogging.\nTIP\nIf you are over age 50 or have heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, or obesity, talk to your health care provider before starting an intense physical activity program. In most cases, you don\u2019t need to talk to your provider before starting a less strenuous activity like walking.\n\n\u201cPhysical activity is a chore.\u201d\n..Physical activity can be fun once you figure out what you like to do. The more enjoyable it is, the more likely you are to stick with it. Walk or take an exercise class with a friend or a group. That way, you can cheer each other on, have company, and feel safer when you are outdoors.\n..Start a small garden in your yard or in a community space.\n..Break physical activity into short blocks of time. Taking three 10-minute walks during your day may be easier than taking one 30-minute walk.\n..Vary what you do from day to day so you \ncan stay interested. \n..You may not like being active outdoors \nbecause of safety concerns. If this is true \nfor you, join your local recreation or \nfitness center or go to a relative\u2019s \nneighborhood to walk.\n\u201cI spend time and money on my hair and don\u2019t want to mess it up.\u201d\n..Talk with your stylist about hairstyles that \nfit your budget and your activity level.\n..Try a natural hairstyle.\n..Wrap or pull hair away from your face \nwhen you exercise.\n..Get a short or easy-care hairstyle.\n..Try braids, twists, weaves, or locs.\n..To remove salt that builds up in hair from day-to-day activities, shampoo with a mild, PH-balanced product at least once a week.\nHair stylist putting curlers in a woman's hair.\nTIP\nFor more tips on keeping natural, relaxed, or braided hairstyles looking good during and after exercise, see Hair Care Tips for Sisters On The Move at http:\/\/cdn1.sph.harvard.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/135\/2012\/09\/sisters.pdf.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive.\u201d\nThere are lots of ways to be physically active that are free or low cost: \n..Find a local park or school track where you can walk.\n..Walk around a mall.\n..Be active with your grandchildren\u2014\ntake a walk, toss a softball, or ride bikes (don\u2019t forget the helmets). \n\u201cI don\u2019t have enough time.\u201d\nNo matter how busy you are, there are ways to fit in 30 minutes or more of physical activity each day: \n..Spread exercise throughout the day, rather than doing it all \nat once.\n..Set aside time to be active. For instance, make it part of your daily routine to walk after breakfast or dinner.  \n..Get up and move. Take breaks from sitting at the computer or watching TV. \n..If you have a job that requires a lot of sitting, walk around the block when you take your break. Send computer files to the printer farthest from your desk so you can move around a little more.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an athlete, so why strength train?\u201d\nActivities to build strength are good for everyone, including older adults. For example, lifting weights may help protect your bones. Strength training may also help you perform your daily activities with more ease. In addition to weight lifting, there are many ways to become stronger:\n..Use canned foods or filled water bottles as weights to work your arms, shoulders, and back.\n..If you are able to, walk up stairs\u2014lifting your body weight strengthens your legs \nand hips.\nTIP\nTo avoid injury, it is important to use good form when you do strengthening activities. You can learn about proper form in Go4Life, a physical activity program for older adults. See the Resources section at the end of this publication for more information.\nSmiling middle-aged woman wearing a towel around her neck after exercising.\n\n\nWhat are some simple ideas for eating well?\n..Start every day with breakfast. Try oatmeal or a whole-grain cereal with fat-free or low-fat milk. Smear fruit spread or fat-free or low-fat yogurt on whole-wheat toast. Enjoy some fruit with your breakfast, too.\n..Make half of what\u2019s on your plate fruit and vegetables. \n..Choose fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese instead of full-fat dairy products.\n..Choose whole grains more often than refined grains. Whole-wheat bread and pasta, oatmeal, and brown rice have more dietary fiber than white bread, rice, and pasta. Dietary fiber helps keep you regular.\n..Don\u2019t let sweets like cookies, candy, or sugary sodas and fruit juices crowd out healthy foods.\nElderly couple eating a meal outside.\nMake healthy meals that taste good\nFried foods and fatty meats may taste good, but they are high in saturated fat, which is not healthy for your heart. There are other ways to add flavor to your food: \n..Bake, roast, broil, grill, or oven-fry chicken or fish\u2014season with herbs, spices, lemon, lime, or vinegar (but not salt).\n..Cook collard greens or kale with onions, garlic, chicken broth, or bouillon. Try olive oil instead of butter, margarine, or high-fat meats. Use broth, bouillon, and cured meats like turkey bacon or ham in small amounts because they are high in sodium (salt). Or you can buy low-sodium versions.\n..Top baked potatoes with salsa, a small amount of fat-free sour cream, or low-fat cottage cheese.\nGrilled salmion and rice.\nTIP\nMost Americans need more calcium, which builds strong bones and teeth. If you can\u2019t digest milk, try lactose-free milk that is fat-free or low-fat. Fat-free or low-fat yogurt and hard cheeses like cheddar may also be easier to digest than milk. \nYou can also get calcium from fruit juices, cereals, and soy beverages that have been enriched with calcium. Eating dark leafy vegetables can also help you meet your body\u2019s calcium needs. Good sources include collard greens and kale. Canned fish with soft bones like salmon or sardines is also a good source of calcium.\n\nSave time and money when you cook\nYou don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time in the kitchen or a lot of money to eat well:\n..Cook enough to last. Casseroles and a whole cooked chicken may last for several days. (Be sure to freeze or refrigerate leftovers right away to keep them safe to eat).\n..Buy frozen or canned vegetables (no salt added) and canned fruit packed in juice rather than syrup. To reduce the amount of salt in canned vegetables, rinse them in plain water. These foods are just as good for you as fresh produce. They also last longer on the shelf or in the freezer and make quick and easy additions to your meals.\n..Check the grocery newspaper advertisements for specials, clip coupons, and look for produce in season (when it is cheaper) \nand\/or at a farmers market. \nWoman holding a bag of groceries.\nTIP\nVisit the \u201cFood and Nutrition\u201d section of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) website for tips on a number of topics related to healthy food, shopping, and affordable meal planning. See http:\/\/www.usda.gov and the Resources section at the end of this brochure for more information on federal dietary guidelines.\n\nHow can reading the Nutrition Facts label help me?\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Nutrition Facts label appears on most packaged foods. It tells you how many calories and servings are in a box or can. The label also shows how many nutrients like fat, fiber, sodium, and sugar are in one serving of food. You can use these facts to figure out how many calories you are eating and to make healthy food choices.1 Here are some tips on how reading food labels can help you make healthy food choices:\nNutrition Facts label with Calories and \n% Daily Value information highlighted in color. \n \n1For more information on reading food labels, see the brochure Using the Nutrition Facts Label: A How-to Guide for Older Adults, listed under Resources.\n\nCalories n \nAll the information on a food label is \nbased on the serving size. Be careful\u2014\none serving may be much smaller than you think. If you have two servings, you will be eating two times the calories and nutrients noted in the label.\n% Daily Value n \nThe % Daily Value (% DV) is a general guide to help you get the right amount of nutrients in your diet. This number tells you whether a food is high or low in nutrients. Foods that have more than 20% DV of a nutrient are high in that nutrient. Foods that have 5% DV or less are low in that nutrient. Limit the amount of cholesterol and sodium (salt) by looking for low DV percentages for these items.\nNutrition Facts label with Fat and Added Sugar information highlighted in color. \n \nn Oils, Solid Fats, and Added Sugars\nSolid fats like butter, shortening, and margarine can have high levels of saturated or trans fats, which are not heart healthy. You can read the ingredients list and choose foods that are low in saturated fat (5% DV or less per serving). Instead of solid fats, choose liquid fats or soft margarines. Good sources are plant-based oils like sunflower, corn, soybean, cottonseed, and safflower. \nKeep track of the added sugars that you eat. Added sugars may often be \u201cdisguised\u201d in ingredients lists (for example, corn syrup). Choose foods with little or no added sugar, \nlike low-sugar cereals. Limit drinks sweetened with sugar.\nn Trans Fat \nThis type of fat is created when liquid oils are changed into solid fats, like shortening and some margarines, so they will last longer without going bad. This type of fat may be found in crackers, cookies, and snack foods. Trans fat raises your LDL (bad) cholesterol and lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol. Try not to eat much trans fat.\nNutrition Facts label with Sodium and Dietary Fiber information highlighted in color. \n \nSodium (Salt) n \nSalt contains sodium. Eating less sodium may help lower blood pressure, which may help reduce the risk of heart disease. Eat less than 1,500 mg per day, or about 2\/3 of a teaspoon of table salt. This includes sodium within foods you eat as well as extra salt you may add at the table or while cooking. When comparing food labels, choose foods that are low in sodium (5% DV or less per serving).\nFiber n \nThere are different types of dietary fiber. Insoluble fiber, found in food like whole grains and vegetables, helps with digestion and keeping you regular. Soluble fiber, found in foods like oatmeal and beans (such as navy, black, and pinto beans), may improve your cholesterol and blood sugar. Other sources of fiber are peas, lentils, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, bran, and nuts. Leaving the peels on your fruits and vegetables, such as apples and tomatoes, can add extra fiber as well. Choose foods that are high in fiber (20% DV or more per serving).\nNutrition Facts label with Calcium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B12 information highlighted in color. \n \nn Calcium \nLack of calcium can lead to bone loss. Choose foods that are high in calcium (at least 20% DV) and low in fat.\nn Vitamins\nVitamin D. This vitamin helps your body absorb calcium. Choose foods high in vitamin D, like fresh, frozen, or canned salmon, shrimp, and light tuna. Be active outside in the sunlight (with sunscreen) to improve vitamin D levels naturally. Ask your health care provider if you should take vitamin D.  \nVitamin B12. This vitamin helps the body make red blood cells and maintain healthy nerve cells. Older adults often have difficulty absorbing enough vitamin B12. Eat foods with added vitamin B12, such as cereals made from oat bran \nor whole-grain wheat bran. Ask your \nhealth care provider if you should take vitamin B12.\nTIP\nMany food labels say \u201clow-fat,\u201d \u201creduced fat,\u201d or \u201clight.\u201d But these claims don\u2019t always mean the food is low in calories. Remember, fat-free does not mean calorie-free, and calories do count!\n\nWhat should I do if I\u2019m a vegetarian?\nMany people are now getting more vegetables on their plates by enjoying \u201cmeatless Mondays\u201d or becoming vegetarians. If you\u2019re a vegetarian, you can get the nutrients you need in a vegetarian diet by eating a variety of foods. Just make sure you watch your portions and work within the calorie guidelines based on your sex, age, and activity level.\nHere are some ideas for people who prefer to eat mostly plant-based foods:\n..Build meals around sources of protein that are naturally low in fat, like beans, lentils, or peas.  \n..Try veggie burgers instead of hamburgers. Many different kinds are available, made with soybeans, vegetables, and\/or rice.\n..To get enough calcium, try foods that have been enriched with calcium, such as soymilk, tofu, breakfast cereals, and orange juice.\n..If you don\u2019t eat any animal products at all, choose foods that are high in iron, like spinach and lentils, and foods with added vitamin B12 (check the Nutrition Facts label).\nSalad with mandarin orange slices.\nHow can I eat well when away from home? \nIn real life, you can\u2019t always cook your meals. Here are some ways to make healthy choices when you are away from home: \n..Use a small plate to help keep you from \neating too much.\n..At restaurants, share a meal with a friend or take half of it home.\n..Order one or two appetizers or side dishes instead of a whole meal.\nTIPS\n\u2022\tUse oils or soft margarine (margarine in tub or liquid form) instead of butter. Choose a soft margarine that has less than 2 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon and has 0 grams of trans fat. \u201cLiquid vegetable oil\u201d should be first on the ingredient list. (American Heart Association) \n\u2022\tTry keeping a food diary. Write down what you eat, when you eat, and how you feel when you eat. Keeping a diary can help you understand your eating habits.

All Rights Reserved. www.dimensionalresearch.com<\/p><p>&nbsp;Dimensional Research | April 2017<\/p><p>&nbsp;It is common knowledge that mobile devices are integral to both our personal and business lives. With cyberattacks against individuals, businesses, and government entities increasing in frequency and sophistication, it is no surprise that mobile devices are now considered by threat actors to be one of the weakest links in the IT infrastructure of most enterprises. This report finds that 2 out of 10 companies have already experienced a mobile cyberattack, with an even larger number completely unaware whether they have been breached. While the cost of a mobile breach is similar to that of a desktop or laptop breach, a third of those surveyed stated the risk of data loss is higher on mobile devices. Meanwhile, two thirds of the surveys participants stated they are doubtful that their organizations can defend against a mobile cyberattack, while nearly all security professionals believe the number of mobile attacks will increase rapidly.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Just over one third of companies have deployed a mobile threat defense solution, with a lack of resources cited as the primary reason for going without advanced mobile security. That said, this research found that just over half of companies are increasing budget and resources to secure mobile devices compared to previous years. Currently, the threat is growing but focus and resource allocation appears insufficient to properly secure mobile devices.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Key Findings&nbsp; Security Professionals Unprepared and Not Confident<\/p><p>&nbsp;- 64% of participants are doubtful their organizations can prevent a mobile cyberattack - Over 1\/3 of companies fail to adequately secure mobile devices - More than half believe risk of data loss is equal to or greater than desktops\/laptops<\/p><p>&nbsp; Mobile Devices to Come Under Increasing Attacks - 20% of companies mobile devices have been breached, and 24% dont know whether theyve experienced<\/p><p>&nbsp;an attack - 94% expect the frequency of mobile attacks to increase - 79% state the difficulty of securing mobile devices is growing<\/p><p>&nbsp;Sponsored by<\/p><p>&nbsp;Page 2<\/p><p>&nbsp;Dimensional Research | April 2017<\/p><p>&nbsp;www.dimensionalresearch.com&nbsp; 2017 Dimensional Research.All Rights Reserved.Page 3<\/p><p>&nbsp;THE GROWING THREAT OF MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY BREACHES A GLOBAL SURVEY OF SECURITY PROFESSIONALS<\/p><p>&nbsp;Detailed Findings 20% of survey respondents stated that their company has already experienced a mobile device security breach, while just over half stated they have not. Perhaps the most surprising finding is that 24% of the security professionals are unaware if they have been compromised. Often not knowing you have been hacked is worse than knowing. These security professionals have little visibility into the security of the mobile devices in their businesses. Keep in mind that many of the recent and most highly-publicized security breaches revealed that the hacked businesses were oblivious to the breach for quite some time.<\/p><p>&nbsp;When security professionals were asked directly if their companys mobile devices were adequately secured, only 64% stated they were. Approximately 1\/3 of the companies are aware that mobile devices and the data on them are currently at risk&nbsp; a risk they know and state could be better mitigated. Perhaps some companies believe the data loss or pirated corporate access via mobile devices is just not that dangerous.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Yes 64%<\/p><p>&nbsp;No 36%<\/p><p>&nbsp;In your opinion, does your company adequately secure mobile devices that connect to corporate resources?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Yes 20%<\/p><p>&nbsp;No 56%<\/p><p>&nbsp;I don't know 24%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Has your company ever experienced a security breach on or from a mobile device?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Dimensional Research | April 2017<\/p><p>&nbsp;www.dimensionalresearch.com&nbsp; 2017 Dimensional Research.All Rights Reserved.Page 4<\/p><p>&nbsp;THE GROWING THREAT OF MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY BREACHES A GLOBAL SURVEY OF SECURITY PROFESSIONALS<\/p><p>&nbsp;17% of the participants felt the risk of data loss on mobile devices was equal to the risk of data loss with desktop and laptop computers. However, 34%, representing one in three participants, believe the potential for data loss is greater on mobile devices. Perhaps the high level of concern is based on the frequency of mobile device loss or theft, as well as the limited security measures companies use to protect enterprise mobile devices.<\/p><p>&nbsp;When posed with the question What types of attacks have occurred on mobile devices at your company? it was expected that one or two modes of attack would rise to the top. Instead, security professionals reported a broad range of successful attacks against their organizations mobile devices. This places increased challenges not only on security professionals, but on defensive strategies and solutions for mobile devices.<\/p><p>&nbsp;41%<\/p><p>&nbsp;43%<\/p><p>&nbsp;54%<\/p><p>&nbsp;54%<\/p><p>&nbsp;58%<\/p><p>&nbsp;0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Key logging and credential theft<\/p><p>&nbsp;Intercepted calls and text messages over a mobile carriers network (SS7 Attacks)<\/p><p>&nbsp;Network attacks (through connections to malicious WiFi, or Man-in-the-Middle attacks)<\/p><p>&nbsp;Phishing using text messages (SMS)<\/p><p>&nbsp;Malware<\/p><p>&nbsp;What types of attacks have occurred on mobile devices at your company?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Mobile devices 34%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Desktops \/ laptops 49%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Risk for data loss is the same for mobile<\/p><p>&nbsp;devices and computers<\/p><p>&nbsp;17%<\/p><p>&nbsp;In your experience, which has a greater chance for data loss: mobile devices or desktops \/ laptops?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Dimensional Research | April 2017<\/p><p>&nbsp;www.dimensionalresearch.com&nbsp; 2017 Dimensional Research.All Rights Reserved.Page 5<\/p><p>&nbsp;THE GROWING THREAT OF MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY BREACHES A GLOBAL SURVEY OF SECURITY PROFESSIONALS<\/p><p>&nbsp;It is likely the combination of successful mobile attacks, lack of visibility and inadequately secured devices drove 64% of those surveyed to state they are not confident they can prevent a cyberattack targeted at mobile devices. Another factor contributing to the lack of confidence is the constant evolution of threats and the relentless barrage from hackers. Company executives should be highly concerned, as only one of three of those charged with securing devices used in the enterprise are confident they can do so.<\/p><p>&nbsp;The future looks more daunting and the risk appears to be increasing, as 94% of those surveyed expect the frequency of mobile device attacks to increase, and 79% expect the task of securing mobile devices to become increasingly difficult. Given the lack of confidence today and the growing threats in the future, it appears that mobile device security will become an increasingly vulnerable spot in most companies cybersecurity defenses.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Yes 36%<\/p><p>&nbsp;No 49%<\/p><p>&nbsp;I don't know 15%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Are you confident that your organization can prevent an advanced cyberattack on employees mobile devices?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Yes 94%<\/p><p>&nbsp;No 6%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Based on your experience will the frequency and types of attacks targeting mobile devices increase over the next 12 months?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Yes 79%<\/p><p>&nbsp;No 21%<\/p><p>&nbsp;In your opinion, will it be more challenging to secure mobile devices in the future than it is currently?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Dimensional Research | April 2017<\/p><p>&nbsp;www.dimensionalresearch.com&nbsp; 2017 Dimensional Research.All Rights Reserved.Page 6<\/p><p>&nbsp;THE GROWING THREAT OF MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY BREACHES A GLOBAL SURVEY OF SECURITY PROFESSIONALS<\/p><p>&nbsp;But often the time, budget, and resources focused on enterprise security initiatives are directly related to the cost of a breach on the company. In the figure below, participants quantified the cost of a cyberattack to an enterprise mobile device and compared it to that of a desktop or laptop attack. While at the bottom end we see a cheaper cost per breach for mobile devices, the rest of the data shows that the costs are somewhat similar. While some of the data indicates that a mobile breach may cost less, it is not a dramatic difference, with over 20% of the participants saying that a mobile breach could cost the company more than $500 thousand dollars. Its clear that the surveys respondents consider the data lost in a potential cyberattack on enterprise mobile highly valuable. That perceived value of enterprise data from such a mobile attack is obviously shared by hackers, who have clearly increased their focus of attacks on mobile devices.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Earlier in this report, those surveyed showed a lack of confidence in their current mobile device security and were extremely doubtful of their organizations ability to prevent an attack. This finding&nbsp; that only 38% of the companies have a dedicated mobile device security solution&nbsp; may be the key reason. More than half the organizations surveyed use only enterprise mobile management platforms to protect devices against advanced cyberattacks.<\/p><p>&nbsp;12% 13% 11%<\/p><p>&nbsp;15% 16%<\/p><p>&nbsp;19%<\/p><p>&nbsp;15%<\/p><p>&nbsp;24%<\/p><p>&nbsp;11% 12%<\/p><p>&nbsp;16% 14%<\/p><p>&nbsp;12% 11%<\/p><p>&nbsp;0%<\/p><p>&nbsp;5%<\/p><p>&nbsp;10%<\/p><p>&nbsp;15%<\/p><p>&nbsp;20%<\/p><p>&nbsp;25%<\/p><p>&nbsp;30%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Less than $10K<\/p><p>&nbsp;$10-25K $25-50K $50-100K $100-500K $500K-1M More than $1M<\/p><p>&nbsp;How much do you estimate a desktop\/laptop breach vs. a mobile breach would cost your organization in US dollars?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Desktop<\/p><p>&nbsp;Mobile<\/p><p>&nbsp;Yes 38%<\/p><p>&nbsp;No 54%<\/p><p>&nbsp;I don't know 8%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Excluding MDM\/EMM, has your company deployed a mobile security solution to protect smartphones and tablets from advanced mobile cyberattacks?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Dimensional Research | April 2017<\/p><p>&nbsp;www.dimensionalresearch.com&nbsp; 2017 Dimensional Research.All Rights Reserved.Page 7<\/p><p>&nbsp;THE GROWING THREAT OF MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY BREACHES A GLOBAL SURVEY OF SECURITY PROFESSIONALS<\/p><p>&nbsp;We then asked survey participants why their company hadnt deployed a mobile device security solution. Over 60% of respondents indicated some lack of resources (i.e. budget, shortage of personnel) or lack of experience as the key drivers. Only 37% made a conscious appraisal for their company and decided there was not enough risk to warrant the investment.<\/p><p>&nbsp;With the generally accepted rise in mobile malware and attacks, it was not surprising that 62% of companies are dedicating more resources to the growing threat. This data supports the earlier finding that resources are constraining the ability to deploy adequate mobile device security solutions. Meanwhile, 8% of the surveyed companies were actually allocating fewer resources to the growing problem of mobile security.<\/p><p>&nbsp;12%<\/p><p>&nbsp;31%<\/p><p>&nbsp;33%<\/p><p>&nbsp;37%<\/p><p>&nbsp;41%<\/p><p>&nbsp;53%<\/p><p>&nbsp;0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Mobile device security solutions are not enterprise-ready<\/p><p>&nbsp;MDM\/EMM solutions provide enough security<\/p><p>&nbsp;Lack of experience implementing a mobile device security solution<\/p><p>&nbsp;Not enough risk to warrant a dedicated solution<\/p><p>&nbsp;Shortage of resources<\/p><p>&nbsp;Lack of budget<\/p><p>&nbsp;Which of the following are reasons why your company does not use an advanced mobile cyberattack protection solution?<\/p><p>&nbsp;More resources than two years ago<\/p><p>&nbsp;62%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Same amount of resources<\/p><p>&nbsp;30%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Fewer resources than two years ago<\/p><p>&nbsp;8%<\/p><p>&nbsp;In comparison to two years ago, are more or fewer resources focused on mobile device security at your company?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Dimensional Research | April 2017<\/p><p>&nbsp;www.dimensionalresearch.com&nbsp; 2017 Dimensional Research.All Rights Reserved.Page 8<\/p><p>&nbsp;THE GROWING THREAT OF MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY BREACHES A GLOBAL SURVEY OF SECURITY PROFESSIONALS<\/p><p>&nbsp;The other component of the lack of resources cited earlier is budgeting. Here, just over half of the surveyed companies (58%) will receive more budget to mitigate the mobile device security threat, and 39% are left with the same budget they had in 2016. It is clear why so many security professionals are doubtful about their ability to prevent cyberattacks on mobile devices given the lack of resources, budget, and dedicated mobile device security solutions.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Conclusion This research indicates that many companies are under imminent risk, as 64% of security professionals who are charged with protecting mobile devices from cyberattacks are doubtful they can do so. Over a third of these professionals stated that today their mobile devices are not sufficiently protected or secure. With the proliferation of mobile devices as business tools it is hard to believe than only 38% of the companies have a security solution focused on protecting mobile devices and the data on them. This research shows that security professionals lack the resources and tools to be properly prepared, but even more surprising is that nearly a quarter of them dont know if their companys mobile devices have been breached or are leaking corporate data. Over 1\/3 of those surveyed believe that the risk of data loss from a mobile device is higher than desktop or laptop computers.<\/p><p>&nbsp;These findings illustrate that the mobile device risk is real for businesses today and that 1 out of every 5 companies admitted to already being breached. The future is bleak for security professionals as 94% shared that their expert perspective is that the frequency of mobile device attacks will increase and 79% stated that it will become even more difficult to secure mobile devices. Without a change to these trends, the frequency and success of mobile devices attacks will rapidly increase. The dichotomy of management trying to control costs and security professionals struggling with insufficient tools to repel attackers is not a new story line in most enterprises. Unfortunately, the story usually ends sadly with a huge, embarrassing event with the press blazing headlines of a costly hack and the company suffering brand damage and loss of customer confidence. Will 2017 be the year of the first humiliating public hack via a mobile device? That remains to be seen.<\/p><p>&nbsp;12% 46% 39% 2% 1%<\/p><p>&nbsp;0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%<\/p><p>&nbsp;Has the amount of budget allocated for securing mobile devices increased or decreased over previous years?<\/p><p>&nbsp;Significantly increased<\/p><p>&nbsp;Slightly increased<\/p><p>&nbsp;Stayed the same<\/p><p>&nbsp;Slightly decreased<\/p><p>&nbsp;Significantly decreased<\/p><p>&nbsp;Dimensional Research | April 2017<\/p><p>&nbsp;www.dimensionalresearch.com&nbsp; 2017 Dimensional Research.All Rights Reserved.Page 9<\/p><p>&nbsp;THE GROWING THREAT OF MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY BREACHES A GLOBAL SURVEY OF SECURITY PROFESSIONALS<\/p><p>&nbsp;Survey Methodology Security professionals worldwide from an independent global database were invited to participate in a survey on the topic of mobile device security.

However, when archiving greater numbers of documents and files, you will benefit from using either a specialized program to backup files (like Cobian Backup) or a file synchronisation tool, programs that ensure that both the original or source location and the new location have exactly same content. Apart from Cobian Backup, there are many tools for helping you to archive or backup your documents; here is our recommended list as follows:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Freebyte Backup is a freeware backup program designed for Microsoft Windows;<\/div><div>&nbsp;Unison File Synchronizer is a free and open source program for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and GNU\/Linux;<\/div><div>&nbsp;Allway Sync is a freeware Microsoft Windows files synchronisation tool;<\/div><div>&nbsp;FreeFileSync is a free and open source files synchronisation tool for GNU\/Linux and Microsoft Windows;<\/div><div>&nbsp;Time Machine is a backup utility developed by Apple, included with Mac OS (version 10.5 and up);<\/div><div>&nbsp;Ubuntu GNU\/Linux users please read Backup Your System guide describing tools you may use.<\/div><div>&nbsp;1.1 Things you should know about Cobian Backup before you start<\/div><div>&nbsp;Cobian Backup is used to archive, (or to make a backup copy) of your files and directories. Backups can be stored in other directories or drives on your computer, other computers on the office network, or on removable devices (CDs, DVDs and USB memory sticks).<\/div><div>&nbsp;Cobian Backup lets you archive your directories and files on a regular basis. It works silently in the background on your system (that is, in the system tray), checking your schedule and executing the backup process when necessary. Cobian Backup can also compress and encrypt files as it generates the backup file.<\/div><div>&nbsp;2.0 Install Cobian Backup<\/div><div>&nbsp;Installation Note: Before you begin the installation process, verify that you have both the latest versions of the Microsoft Windows Installer and the Microsoft.NET Framework.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Installing Cobian Backup is a relatively easy and quick procedure. To begin installing Cobian Backup, perform the following steps:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 1. Double click ; the Open File - Security Warning dialog box may appear. If it does, click to activate the light blue Extracting the resource progress status bar, followed a few moments later by the following screen:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 2. Click to activate the Please read and accept the license agreement screen; check the I accept option, and then click again to activate the following screen:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 3. Click to activate the following screen:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 4. Check the Use Local System account option in the Service options pane, so that your own resembles Figure 3 above.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Important: This option ensures that Cobian Backup will be running silently in the background all the time, so that your backups will occur as scheduled.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 5. Click to activate the following message prompt:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 6. Click to activate the next installation screen, and then click to continue with the installation process.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 7. Click to complete the installation process. After the installation process has been completed, the Cobian Backup icon will appear in the Windows System Tray as follows: .<\/div><div>&nbsp;2.1 Backup Your Directories and Files<\/div><div>&nbsp;In this section you will learn how to perform a simple backup or archive of a specified files and\/or folders. Cobian Backup uses a backup task which can be configured to include a specified group of files and\/or folders. A backup task can be set to run on a specified day and time.<\/div><div>&nbsp;To create a new backup task, perform the following step:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 1. Click to create a new backup task, and activate the New task window as follows:<\/div><div>&nbsp;The left sidebar lists a number of tabs and their associated screens - used to set different backup options and parameters - are displayed in the pane at right. All the options in the General tab are described below:<\/div><div>&nbsp;2.1.1 Option Descriptions<\/div><div>&nbsp;Task Name: This Task Name text field lets you enter a name for the backup task. Use a name that identifies the nature of the backup. For example, if the backup is going to contain video files, you could name it Video Backup.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Disabled: This option must be left unchecked.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Warning: Enabling the Disabled option will override the rest of the options, and prevent the backup task from running.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Include Subdirectories: This option lets you include all the subdirectories\/folders within a selected directory\/folder for the backup task. This is an efficient method for backing up a large number of folders and\/or files. As an example, if you select the My Documents folder and check this option, then all files and folders in My Documents will be included in the backup task.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Create separated backups using timestamps: This option lets you specify that the date and time of the backup task will be automatically included in the folder name containing your backup file. This is a good idea because it means that you will easily be able to identify when the backup was performed.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Use file attribute logic: This option is only relevant when you choose to perform an incremental or differential backup (see below). File attributes contain information about the file.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Note: The following option is only available for Windows OS versions more recent than and including Windows XP.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Use Volume Shadow Copy: This option lets you backup files which are locked.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Cobian Backup verifies this information to determine whether there has been a change in the source file from the last time a backup was performed. If you then run an Differential or Incremental backup, the file will be updated.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Note: You will only be able to run a full or 'dummy backup' if you disable this option (the dummy backup option is explained below).<\/div><div>&nbsp;2.1.2 Backup Type Descriptions<\/div><div>&nbsp;Full: This option means that every single file in the source location will be copied to your backup directory. If you have enabled the Create separated backups using timestamp option, you will have several copies of the same source (identified by the time and date of the backup in the folder title). Otherwise, Cobian Backup will overwrite the previous version (if any).<\/div><div>&nbsp;Incremental: This option means the program will verify if the files selected for backup have been changed since the last backup was performed. If there has been no change, it will be skipped over during the backup process, saving backup time. The Use file attribute logic option needs to be checked in order to perform this backup.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Differential: The program will check if the source has been changed from the last full backup. If there is no need to copy that file, it will be skipped, saving backup time. If you have run a full backup before on the same set of files, then you can continue backing it up, using the Differential method.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Dummy task: You can use this option to get your computer to run or shut down programs at certain times. This is a more advanced option which is not really relevant to our basic backup procedure.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 2. Click to confirm your search options and parameters for your backup task.<\/div><div>&nbsp;2.2 Create a Backup File<\/div><div>&nbsp;To begin creating a backup file, perform the following steps:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 1. Click in the left sidebar of the New task window to display a blank version of the following screen:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 2. Select the files you want to back up. (In Figure 3 above, the My Documents folder is selected.)<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 3. Click in the Source pane to activate the following menu:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Figure 4: The Source pane - Add button menu<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 4. Select Directory if you want to back up an entire directory, and Files to back up individual files. To specify individual files or directories to be backed up, select Manually, and type in the file path or directory for your backup.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Note: You can add as many files or directories as you like. If you wish to back up files currently on your FTP server, choose the FTP site option (you will need to have the appropriate server login details).<\/div><div>&nbsp;When you have selected the files and\/or folders, they will appear in the Source area. As you can see in Figure 3 above, the My Documents folder is displayed there, meaning this folder will now be included in the backup task.<\/div><div>&nbsp;The Destination pane specifies where the backup will be stored.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 5. Click in the Destination pane to activate the following menu:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Figure 5: The Destination pane - Add button menu<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 6. Select Directory to open a browser window where you select the destination folder for your backup file.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Note: If you want to create several versions of the backup file, you may specify several folders here. If you selected the Manually option, you must type in the full path to the folder where you want to keep the backup. To use a remote Internet server to store your archive, select the FTP site option (you will need to have the appropriate server login details).<\/div><div>&nbsp;The screen should now resemble the example above example with file(s) and\/or folder(s) in the source area and folder(s) in the destination area. However, don't click OK just yet! You still need to set a schedule for your backup.<\/div><div>&nbsp;2.3 How to Schedule Your Backup Task<\/div><div>&nbsp;For your automatic backup to work, you need to fill in the Schedule section. This section lets you specify when you want the backup to be performed.<\/div><div>&nbsp;To set the schedule options, perform the following steps:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 1. Select from the left sidebar, to activate the following pane:<\/div><div>&nbsp;options are listed in the drop-down menu, and described below:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Once: The backup will be done once only at the date and time specified in the Date\/Time area.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Daily: The backup will be done every day at the time specified in the Date\/Time area.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Weekly: The backup will be done on the days of the week selected. In the example above, the backup will be done on Fridays. You may select other days also. The backup will be done on all days selected at the time specified in the Date\/Time area.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Monthly: The backup will be done on the days typed into the days of the month box at the time specified in the Date\/Time area.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Yearly: The backup will be done on the days typed into the days of the month box, during the month specified, and at the time specified in the Date\/Time area.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Timer: The backup will be done repeatedly at intervals specified in the Timer text box in the Date\/Time area.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Manually: You will have to run the backup yourself from the main program window.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 2. Click to confirm the options and settings for the backup schedule as follows:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Once you have decided on a backup schedule, you have completed the final step. The backup will now run on the folders specified according to the schedule you have chosen.<\/div><div>&nbsp;3.0 Compress Your Backup File<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 1. Create a backup task containing the backup files you want to archive, as documented in the Create a Backup File section.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 2. Select from the left sidebar to activate the New task screen as follows:<\/div><div>&nbsp;pane is used to specify the method for compressing your backup.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Note: Compression is used to reduce the amount of space for file storage. If you have a bunch of old files that you use only occasionally, but you still want to keep, it would make sense to store them in a format where they take up as little space as possible. Compression works by removing a lot of unnecessary coding out of your documents, while leaving important information intact. Compression does not damage your original data. The files are not viewable when compressed. The process must be reversed and your files 'decompressed' when you want to view the files again.<\/div><div>&nbsp;The three sub-options in the Compression type drop-down list are:<\/div><div>&nbsp;No Compression: This option does not perform any compression, as you would expect.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Zip Compression: This option is the standard compression technique for Windows systems, and the most convenient. Archives once created can be opened with standard Windows tools (or you can download the ZipGenius program to access them).<\/div><div>&nbsp;Selecting a compression type listed automatically enables the Split options section, and its corresponding drop-down list.<\/div><div>&nbsp;The Split options apply to storage on removable media, for example CDs, DVDs, floppy disks and USB memory sticks. The various split options will subdivide the archive into sizes that will fit onto your storage device of choice.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Example: Let's say that you are archiving a large number of files, and you want to burn them to a CD. However, your archive size turns out to be larger than 700MB (the size of a CD). The splitting function will split the archive into pieces smaller than or equal to 700MB, which you can then burn onto your CDs. If you are planning to back up onto your computer's hard disk, or the files that you want to back up are smaller than the device you plan to store them on, you can skip this section.<\/div><div>&nbsp;The following options are available to you when you click on the Split options drop-down list. Your choice will depend on the type of removable storage device available to you.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Figure 2: The Split Options drop-down list<\/div><div>&nbsp;3,5\" - Floppy disk. This option is big enough to perform backup of a small number of documents<\/div><div>&nbsp;Zip - Zip Disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a special Zip Drive in your computer and the custom-made disks<\/div><div>&nbsp;CD-R - CD disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a CD Writer in your computer and a CD writing program (see DeepBurner Free version or other disk burning tools).<\/div><div>&nbsp;DVD - DVD disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a DVD Writer in your computer and a DVD writing program (see DeepBurner Free version or other disk burning tools).<\/div><div>&nbsp;If you are backing up onto several USB memory sticks you may want to set a custom size.<\/div><div>&nbsp;To do this, perform the following steps:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 1. Select the Custom size (bytes) option, then &lt;b&gt;type&lt;\/b&gt; the size of the archive in bytes into the text field as follows:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Figure 10: The Custom size text field<\/div><div>&nbsp;To give you an idea of sizes<\/div><div>&nbsp;1KB (kilobyte) = 1024 bytes - a one-page text document made in Open Office is approximately 20kb<\/div><div>&nbsp;1MB (megabyte) = 1024 KB - a photo taken on a digital camera is usually between 1 - 3 MB<\/div><div>&nbsp;1GB (gigabyte) = 1024 MB - approximately half hour of a DVD quality movie<\/div><div>&nbsp;Note: When choosing a custom size to split your backup for a CD or DVD disk, Cobian Backup will not copy the backup to your removable device automatically. Rather, it will create your archive in those files on the computer and you will need to burn them to the CD or DVD disk yourself.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Password Protect: This option lets you enter a password to protect the archive. Simply type, then re-type a password into the two boxes provided. When you try to decompress the archive, you will be asked for the password before the task commences.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Note: If you want to secure your archive, you should think about using another method than a password. Cobian Backup lets you encrypt your archive. This will be covered in the Encrypt your Backup File section. Alternatively, you may also refer to the Truecrypt Guide to find out how to create an encrypted storage space on your computer or removable device.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Comment: This option lets you write something descriptive about the archive, but it is not a requirement.<\/div><div>&nbsp;3.1 Decompress Your Backup File<\/div><div>&nbsp;To decompress your backup, perform the following steps:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 1. Select &gt; Tools &gt; Decompressor as shown below;<\/div><div>&nbsp;Figure 3: The Tools menu displaying the Decompressor option<\/div><div>&nbsp;The Decompressor window appears as follows:<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 2. Click to open a browse window to enable you to select the archive you want to decompress.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 3. Select the archive (.zip or .7x file) and then click .<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 4. Select a directory into which you will unpack (output) the archived file.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 5. Click to open another window that lets you choose the folder in which to unpack the archive.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Step 6. Select a folder, and then click .<\/div><div>&nbsp;Use Windows Explorer to view the files that go to that folder.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Encryption may be a necessity for those wishing to keep their backup secure from unauthorised access.<\/div><div>&nbsp;Encryption is the process of encoding, or scrambling, data in such a way that it appears unintelligible to anyone who does not have the specific key needed to decode the message.

For data sources that connect to live databases, you can also control whether users are prompted to provide database credentials when they click a published view. The following three options work together to achieve different results:<\/p><p>&nbsp;Database login account: When you create a data source that connects to a live database, you choose between authenticating to the database through Windows NT or through the databases built-in security mechanism.<\/p><p>&nbsp;Authentication mode: When you publish a data source or a workbook with a live database connection, you can choose an Authentication mode.

His political career, having suffered several controversies, ended after a conviction for perverting the course of justice and his subsequent imprisonment. He is married to Mary Archer, a scientist specialising in solar power.Early life and background.Jeffrey Howard Archer was born in the City of London Maternity Hospital. He was two weeks old when his family moved to the seaside town of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, where he spent most of his early life. His father, William, was sixty-four when Archer was born. He died when Archer was fifteen. In 1951, he won a scholarship to Wellington School, in Somerset (not to be confused with the public school Wellington College, which is possible from the ambiguous biography in Archer's earlier books). At this time his mother, Lola, contributed a column \"Over the teacups\" to the local press in Weston-super-Mare and wrote about the adventures of her son 'Tuppence'; this caused Archer to be the victim of bullying while at Wellington School.After Archer left school passing O-levels in English Literature, Art, and History, he worked in a number of jobs, including training with the army and for the police. This lasted only for a few months, but he fared better as a Physical Education teacher; first at Vicar's Hill School in Hampshire, and later at the more prestigious Dover College in Kent. As a teacher he was popular with pupils and reported by some to have had good motivational skills.Oxford.He gained a place at Brasenose College, Oxford to study for a one-year diploma in education, though he stayed for three years, gaining an academic qualification in teaching awarded by the Oxford Department for Education. There have been claims that Archer provided false evidence of his academic qualifications, for instance the apparent citing of an American institution which was actually a bodybuilding club, in gaining admission to Oxford University. His website includes references to his Oxford 'Principal', yet omits that he was not a full undergraduate at Oxford.It was during this period that he met his wife, Mary. They married in July 1966.Early career.One organisation Archer worked for, the United Nations Association, alleged discrepancies in his claims for expenses, and details appeared in the press in a scrambled form. Archer brought a defamation action against the former Conservative member of parliament Humphry Berkeley, chairman of the UNA, as the source of the allegations. The case was settled out of court after three years. Berkeley tried to persuade Conservative Central Office that Archer was unsuitable as a parliamentary candidate, but a selection meeting at Louth disregarded any doubts.Archer set up his own fund-raising company, Arrow Enterprises, in 1969. That same year he opened an art gallery, the Archer Gallery, in Mayfair. The gallery specialised in modern art, including pieces by the acclaimed sculptor and painter Leon Underwood. The gallery ultimately lost money, however, and Archer sold it two years later.Member of Parliament.At 29, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Lincolnshire constituency of Louth, holding the seat for the Conservative Party in a by-election on 4 December 1969. Archer beat Ian Gow to the selection after winning over a substantial proportion of younger members at the selection meeting. Archer's campaign colour was a dayglo orange\/pink with a blue arrow; the political parties in Lincolnshire had not yet abandoned local colours, which were different from the party national colours.Louth constituency had three key areas: Louth, Cleethorpes, and Immingham. During his time as a Member of Parliament, Archer was a regular at the Immingham Conservative Club in the most working-class part of the constituency.In Parliament, Archer was on the left of the Conservative Party, rebelling against some of his party's policies. He urged free TV licences for the elderly and was against museum charges. Archer voted against restoring capital punishment, saying it was barbaric and obscene. In 1971, he employed David Mellor, then needing money for his bar finals, to deal with his correspondence. He tipped Mellor to reach the cabinet. In an interview Archer said \"I hope we don't return to extremes. I'm what you might call centre-right but I've always disliked the right wing as much as I've disliked the left wing.\"In 1974, he was a casualty of a fraudulent investment scheme involving Aquablast, a Canadian company, a debacle which lost Archer his first fortune. Fearing imminent bankruptcy, he stood down as an MP at the October 1974 general election. By this time the Archers were living in a large five-bedroom house in The Boltons, an exclusive street in South Kensington. As a result of the Aquablast affair, they were forced to sell the house and move into more modest accommodation for a while.Archer remained president of Immingham Conservative Party until he withdrew from the 2000 election for Mayor of London in 1999. Archer is considered a local celebrity by people of Immingham who were around when he was their Member of Parliament (although Archer has no family or business connection with the area). His rare visits to northern Lincolnshire attract considerable local public interest.Politics and writing.His first book, \"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less\", was picked up by the literary agent Deborah Owen and published first in the US, then eventually in Britain in the Autumn of 1976. The book was an instant success and Archer avoided bankruptcy, never being legally declared bankrupt. A BBC Television adaptation of the book was broadcast in 1990, and a radio adaptation was aired on BBC Radio 4 in the early 1980s. While he was a witness in the Aquablast case in Toronto in 1977, Archer was accused of taking three suits from a department store, an accusation he denied for many years. However, in the late 1990s, Archer finally acknowledged that he had indeed taken the suits, although he claimed that at the time he hadn't realised he had left the shop. No charges were brought.\"Kane and Abel\" proved to be his best-selling work, reaching number one on the \"New York Times\" bestsellers list. It was made into a television mini-series by CBS in 1985, starring Peter Strauss and Sam Neill. The following year, Granada TV screened a ten-part adaptation of another Archer bestseller, \"First Among Equals\", which told the story of three men and their quest to become Prime Minister. Archer claims to spend considerable time writing and re-writing each book. He goes abroad to write the first draft, working in blocks of two-hours at a time, then writes anything up to seventeen further drafts. It has been suggested that his books require extensive editing by others to make them readable.In 1979, Archer purchased the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, a house associated with the poet Rupert Brooke. He also began to hold shepherd's pie and Krug parties for prominent people at his London apartment, which overlooks the Houses of Parliament.Archer's political career revived once he became known for his novels and as a popular speaker among the Conservative grassroots. He was made deputy chairman of the Conservative Party by Margaret Thatcher in September 1985. Norman Tebbit, party chairman, had misgivings over the appointment, as did other prominent members of the party, including William Whitelaw and Ted Heath. During his tenure as deputy chairman, Archer was responsible for a number of embarrassing gaffes, including his claim, made during a live radio interview, that many young, unemployed people were simply unwilling to find work. At the time of Archer's comment, unemployment in the UK stood at a record 3.4 million. Archer was later forced to apologise for the remark, suggesting that his words had been \"taken out of context\".Peerage.In 1992, after having been previously rejected, Archer was made a life peer as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, of Mark in the County of Somerset by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister John Major.In a speech at the 1993 Conservative conference, Archer urged the Home Secretary Michael Howard, to \"Stand and deliver\" saying: \"Michael, I am sick and tired of being told by old people that they are frightened to open the door, they're frightened to go out at night, frightened to use the parks and byways where their parents and grandparents walked with freedom... We say to you: stand and deliver!\". He then attacked violent films and urged tougher prison conditions to prevent criminals from re-offending. He criticised the role of \"do-gooders\" and finished off the speech by denouncing the opposition party's Law and Order policies.. On \"Question Time\" in February 1994, Archer stated that 18 should be the age of consent for homosexuality, as opposed to 21, which it was at the time. Archer has also consistently been an opponent of a return to capital punishment.\"Daily Star\" libel case.There was astonishment at the description the judge (Mr Justice Caulfield) gave of Mrs Archer in his jury instructions: \"Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box. Your vision of her probably will never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey?\" The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer, \"Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?\" By this time, according to the journalist Adam Raphael, Jeffrey and Mary Archer were, in fact, living largely separate lives.The editor of the \"Daily Star\", Lloyd Turner, was sacked six weeks after the trial by the paper's owner Lord Stevens of Ludgate.Share dealings.An inquiry was launched by the Stock Exchange into possible insider trading. The Department of Trade and Industry, headed by Michael Heseltine, announced that Archer would not be prosecuted. Archer later claimed that he had been \"exonerated\", but the DTI inquiry had merely stated that there was insufficient evidence to bring a prosecution.Missing Kurdish aid.In July 2001, Scotland Yard began investigating allegations that millions of pounds had disappeared from \"Simple Truth\", a fundraising campaign run by Archer. He set up a charity with the Red Cross. He employed two Kurdish aides, Broosk Saib and Nadhim Zahawi, whom he nicknamed \"Lemon Kurd and Bean Kurd.\"Perjury and downfall.Archer had been selected by the Conservative Party as candidate for the London mayoral election of 2000. He was forced to withdraw when it was revealed that he was facing a charge of perjury.In November 1999, Ted Francis, a friend (who claimed Archer owed him money) and Archer's former personal assistant Angela Peppiatt claimed he had fabricated an alibi in the 1987 trial. They were concerned that Archer was standing as Mayor of London and doubted that he was suitable. Peppiatt had kept a diary of Archer's movements, which contradicted evidence given during the 1987 trial. This formed the basis of the case against Archer.The \"News of the World\" published the allegations on 21 November 1999 and Archer withdrew his candidacy the following day. Conservative leader William Hague said \"This is the end of politics for Jeffrey Archer. I will not tolerate such behaviour in my party\". On 8 October, he had described Archer as a candidate of \"probity and integrity. I'm going to back him all the way\" at the Conservative party conference.On 4 February 2000, Archer was expelled from the Conservative Party for five years. On 26 September 2000, he was charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice during the 1987 libel trial.A few months before the beginning of the perjury trial, Archer began in the star role in a courtroom play (which he also wrote) called \"The Accused\". The play was staged at London's Theatre Royal Haymarket and concerned the court trial of an alleged murderer from beginning to end. The play used the technique of assigning the role of jury in the trial to the audience, theatre-goers voting on whether Archer's character was guilty at the end of each performance. Archer would attend his real trial during the day and be judged in his fictional trial in the evening.The real trial began on 30 May 2001, a month after Monica Coghlan's death. On 19 July 2001, Archer was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at the 1987 trial. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment by Mr Justice Potts. Archer never spoke during the trial, though his wife Mary again gave evidence as she had done during the 1987 trial. Ted Francis was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice. Archer's mother died on 11 July 2001 aged 87, and he was released for the day on 21 July to attend the funeral.Archer was sent to Belmarsh Prison, but was moved to the category \"C\" Wayland Prison in Norfolk on 9 August 2001. Despite automatically qualifying as a category \"D\" prisoner given it was a first conviction and he did not pose serious risk of harm to the public, his status as such was suspended pending a police investigation into Baroness Emma Nicholson's allegations that he had kept funds meant for the \"Simple Truth\" campaign. He was finally transferred to HMP North Sea Camp, an open prison in October 2001. From there he was let out to work at the Theatre Royal in Lincoln, England, and was allowed occasional home visits. Reports in the media claimed he had been abusing this privilege by attending lunches with friends, including former Education Secretary Gillian Shephard and in September 2002 he was transferred to Lincoln Prison for a month. While in prison, he wrote the three-volume memoir \"A Prison Diary\". During his time in prison, he was visited by a number of high-profile friends, including the actor Donald Sinden and the performer Barry Humphries.On 21 July 2003, he was released on licence, after serving half of his sentence, from HMP Hollesley Bay, Suffolk.Many of Archer's friends remained loyal. He and Lady Archer were guests at the memorial service for Norris McWhirter at Saint Martin-in-the-Fields on Thursday 7 October 2004 where they sat in the same pew as former head of the Conservative Monday Club, Gregory Lauder-Frost, and in front of Lady Thatcher, who embraced Lady Archer.On 26 February 2006, on Andrew Marr's \"Sunday AM\" programme, Archer said he had no interest in returning to front-line politics: he would pursue his writing instead. He has confirmed this when speaking at the Emmanuel College Politics Society and the Christ's Politics Society at the University of Cambridge.Archer in fiction.In \"There's No Place Like a Home\", a comedy play by Paul Elliot, the residents of a retirement home for actors and actresses, trying to prevent its closure, kidnap Archer to use the ransom money to keep their home open.The satirical magazine Private Eye refers to Archer as 'Jeffrey Archole' or 'Lord Archole' and characterises him as a liar and fantasist. On occasion it has published spoofs of Archer's fiction, describing a thinly-veiled heroic version of himself called 'Jeremy Bowman'.Archer portrayed himself in a brief portion of \"Bridget Jones's Diary\". The joke was that Bridget always says the wrong thing and was introducing \"The greatest book of our time\" and then spots several famous (and better according to the joke) authors in the crowd, one of which is Lord Archer.In an episode of \"Cluedo\", Reverend Green compares himself to Jeffery Archer in his murder confession.<\/div><div><br><\/div><\/div><div><br><\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q26","QuestionID":"QID26"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID297","SecondaryAttribute":"Tonya thought the boat should be the color:","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e031180-fb35-b651-9db6-f3f6ed8b69db\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Gluten may also be used in products such as vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, and some medicines. Other names for celiac disease are celiac sprue and gluten intolerance. \nYour body\u2019s natural defense system, called the immune system, keeps you healthy by fighting against things that can make you sick, such as bacteria and viruses. When people with celiac disease eat gluten, their body\u2019s immune system reacts to the gluten by attacking the lining of the small intestine. The immune system\u2019s reaction to gluten damages small, fingerlike growths called villi. When the villi are damaged, the body cannot get the nutrients it needs. \n*See page 10 for tips on how to say the words in bold type. Celiac disease is hereditary, meaning it runs in families. Adults and children can have celiac disease. As many as 2 million Americans may have celiac disease, but most don\u2019t know it. \nDrawing of villi on the lining of the small intestine. A cutaway section shows the various tissue of the small intestine. An enlarged inset drawing shows fine details of the villi.  \nVilli on the lining of the small intestine help absorb nutrients. \n\nIs celiac disease serious? \nYes. Celiac disease can be very serious. It often causes long-lasting digestive problems and keeps your body from getting all the nutrition it needs. Over time, celiac disease can cause anemia, infertility, weak and brittle bones, an itchy skin rash, and other health problems. \n\nWhat are the symptoms of celiac disease? \nSymptoms of celiac disease include \n. \nstomach pain \n\n. \ngas \n\n. \ndiarrhea \n\n. \nextreme tiredness \n\n. \nchange in mood \n\n. \nweight loss \n\n. \nan itchy, blistering skin rash \n\n. \nslowed growth \n\n\nSome people with celiac disease may not feel sick or have symptoms. Or if they feel sick, they don\u2019t know celiac disease is the cause. Most people with celiac disease have one or more symptoms. Not all people with celiac disease have digestive problems. Having one or more of these symptoms does not always mean a person has celiac disease because other disorders can cause these symptoms. \n\nHow is celiac disease diagnosed? \nCeliac disease can be hard to diagnose because some of its symptoms are like the symptoms of other diseases. People with celiac disease may go undiagnosed and untreated for many years. If your doctor thinks you have celiac disease, you will need a blood test. You must be on your regular diet before the test. If not, the results could be wrong. \nIf your blood test results show you might have celiac disease, your doctor will perform a biopsy, which involves taking a tiny piece of tissue from your small intestine. A biopsy may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center. \nDrawing of a female health care provider drawing blood from a woman\u2019s arm. The drawing includes a close-up image of the needle being inserted into the woman\u2019s arm vein.  \nYour doctor will provide you instructions about how to prepare for a biopsy. Generally, no eating or drinking is allowed 8 hours before a biopsy. Smoking and chewing gum are also prohibited during this time. Tell your doctor about any health conditions you may have, especially heart and lung problems, diabetes, and allergies. Also tell your doctor about any medicines you take. You may be asked to stop taking them for a short time before and after the test. \nTo perform the biopsy, the doctor inserts a long, narrow tube into your mouth, down through your stomach, and into your small intestine. At the end of the tube are small tools that the doctor uses to snip out a bit of tissue. The tissue will then be viewed with a microscope to look for signs of celiac disease damage. You will take medicine before the biopsy that makes you sleepy and keeps you from feeling any pain. Many people sleep through the procedure. \n\nHow is celiac disease treated? \nThe only treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. If you avoid gluten, your small intestine will heal. If you eat gluten or use items that contain gluten, celiac disease will continue to harm your small intestine. \nHave regular checkups so your doctor can diagnose and treat problems from celiac disease. Celiac disease can cause problems, such as weak or brittle bones, even if you are on a gluten-free diet. \n\nEating, Diet, and Nutrition \nA dietitian can help you select gluten-free foods. A dietitian is an expert in food and healthy eating. You will learn how to check labels of foods and other items for gluten. \nThe following chart lists examples of foods you can eat and foods you should stay away from if you have celiac disease. This list is not complete. A dietitian can help you learn what other foods you can and can\u2019t eat on a gluten-free diet. \nDrawing of a man talking with a female dietitian.

Doctors call this chronic Hepatitis C.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Incarceration and Hepatitis C<\/span><\/p><br><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u00a5<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Hepatitis C can be a health problem for people who have been incarcerated. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u00a5<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Adults in correctional facilities are at risk for Hepatitis C because many people in jails or prisons already have Hepatitis C.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u00a5<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The most common way inmates get Hepatitis C is by sharing equipment used for injecting drugs, tattooing, and piercing with other people who are already infected. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u00a5<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Hepatitis C virus can be spread easily to others through blood, even in very small amounts too small to see. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">How is Hepatitis C spread?<\/span><\/p><br><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Hepatitis C is most often spread when blood from a person who has Hepatitis C enters the body of someone who is not infected.

If this test is positive for Hepatitis C antibodies, a different blood test is needed. The second test will tell if the Hepatitis C virus is still in the body. If this test is positive, it means a person currently has Hepatitis C.

The body needs a small amount of copper from food to stay healthy; however, too much copper is poisonous.  Normally, the liver filters extra copper and releases it into bile.  Bile is a fluid made by the liver that carries toxins and wastes out of the body through the gastrointestinal tract.  In Wilson disease, the liver does not filter copper correctly and copper builds up in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs.  Over time, high copper levels can cause life-threatening organ damage.\n\nWhat is the liver?\nThe liver is the body\u2019s largest internal organ.  The liver is called the body\u2019s metabolic factory because of the important role it plays in metabolism\u2014the way cells change food into energy after food is digested and absorbed into the blood.  The liver has many important functions, including\n\u2022\t\ntaking up, storing, and processing nutrients from food\u2014including fat, sugar, and protein\u2014and delivering them to the rest of the body when needed. \n\n\u2022\t\nmaking new proteins, such as clotting factors and immune factors.\n\n\u2022\t\nproducing bile.  In addition to carrying toxins and waste products out of the body, bile helps the body digest fats and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\n\u2022\t\nremoving waste products the kidneys cannot remove, such as fats, cholesterol, toxins, and medications. \n\n\nDrawing of the digestive tract and liver within an outline of a human body. The liver is labeled. \nThe liver is the body\u2019s largest internal organ.\nA healthy liver is necessary for survival.  The liver can regenerate most of its own cells when they become damaged.  However, if injury to the liver is too severe or long lasting, regeneration is incomplete and the liver creates scar tissue.\n\nWhat causes Wilson disease?\nWilson disease is caused by an inherited autosomal recessive mutation, or change, in the ATP7B gene.  In an autosomal recessive disease, the child has to inherit the gene mutation from both parents to have an increased likelihood for the disease.  The chance of a child inheriting autosomal recessive mutations from both parents with a gene mutation is 25 percent, or one in four.  If only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will not get the disease, although the child may inherit one copy of the gene mutation.  The child is called a \u201ccarrier\u201d of the disease and can pass the gene mutation to the next generation.  Genetic testing is a procedure that identifies changes in a patient\u2019s genes and can show whether a parent or child is a carrier of a mutated gene.  Autosomal recessive diseases are typically not seen in every generation of an affected family.  \nThe following chart shows the chance of inheriting an autosomal recessive mutation from parents who both carry the mutated gene.\nA chart showing how parents pass autosomal recessive mutations to children.  \nThe chance of a child inheriting autosomal recessive mutations from both parents with a gene mutation is 25 percent, or one in four.\n\nGenetic Diseases\nEach cell contains thousands of genes that provide the instructions for making proteins for growth and repair of the body.  If a gene has a mutation, the protein made by that gene may not function properly.  Not all gene mutations cause a disease.  \nPeople have two copies of most genes; they inherit one copy from each parent.  A genetic disease occurs when one or both parents pass a mutated gene to a child at conception.  A genetic disease can also occur through a spontaneous gene mutation, meaning neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene.  Once a spontaneous gene mutation has occurred in a person, that person can pass the gene mutation on to a child.\nRead more about genes and genetic conditions in the U.S. National Library of Medicine\u2019s Genetics Home Reference at www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov.\n\nWho is more likely to develop Wilson disease?\nMen and women develop Wilson disease at equal rates.  About one in 30,000 people have Wilson disease.  Symptoms usually appear between ages 5 and 35; however, new cases have been reported in people ages 3 to 72.1\n1Rosencrantz R, Schilsky M.  Wilson disease:  pathogenesis and clinical considerations in diagnosis and treatment.  Seminars in Liver Disease.  2011;31:245\u2013259.A person\u2019s risk of being a carrier or having Wilson disease increases when his or her family has a known history of Wilson disease.  Some people may not know about a family history of the condition because the mutation is often passed to a child by a parent who is a carrier.  A person\u2019s chances of having Wilson disease increase if a health care provider has diagnosed one or both parents with the condition.  \n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of Wilson disease?\nThe signs and symptoms of Wilson disease vary, depending on what organs of the body are affected.  Wilson disease is present at birth; however, the signs and symptoms of the disease do not appear until the copper builds up in the liver, the brain, or other organs.  \nWhen people have signs and symptoms, they usually affect the liver, the central nervous system, or both.  The central nervous system includes the brain, the spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body.  Sometimes a person does not have symptoms and a health care provider discovers the disease during a routine physical exam or blood test, or during an illness.  Children can have Wilson disease for several years before any signs and symptoms occur.  People with Wilson disease may have\n\u2022\t\nliver-related signs and symptoms\n\n\u2022\t\ncentral nervous system-related signs and symptoms\n\n\u2022\t\nmental health-related signs and symptoms\n\n\u2022\t\nother signs and symptoms \n\n\nLiver-related Signs \nand Symptoms\nPeople with Wilson disease may develop signs and symptoms of chronic, or long lasting, liver disease:  \n\u2022\t\nweakness\n\n\u2022\t\nfatigue, or feeling tired\n\n\u2022\t\nloss of appetite\n\n\u2022\t\nnausea\n\n\u2022\t\nvomiting\n\n\u2022\t\nweight loss\n\n\u2022\t\npain and bloating from fluid accumulating in the abdomen\n\n\u2022\t\nedema\u2014swelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face \n\n\u2022\t\nitching\n\n\u2022\t\nspiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, near the surface of the skin\n\n\u2022\t\nmuscle cramps\n\n\u2022\t\njaundice, a condition that causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow\n\n\nSome people with Wilson disease may not develop signs or symptoms of liver disease until they develop acute liver failure\u2014a condition that develops suddenly. \nCentral Nervous System-related Signs and Symptoms\nCentral nervous system-related symptoms usually appear in people after the liver has retained a lot of copper; however, signs and symptoms of liver disease may not be present.  Central nervous system-related symptoms occur most often in adults and sometimes occur in children.1  Signs and symptoms include\n\u2022\t\ntremors or uncontrolled movements\n\n\u2022\t\nmuscle stiffness\n\n\u2022\t\nproblems with speech, swallowing, or physical coordination\n\n\nA health care provider may refer people with these symptoms to a neurologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in nervous system diseases. \nMental Health-related Signs \nand Symptoms\nSome people will have mental health-related signs and symptoms when copper builds up in the central nervous system.  Signs and symptoms may include\n\u2022\t\npersonality changes\n\n\u2022\t\ndepression\n\n\u2022\t\nfeeling anxious, or nervous, about most things\n\n\u2022\t\npsychosis\u2014when a person loses contact with reality\n\n\nOther Signs and Symptoms \nOther signs and symptoms of Wilson disease may include\n\u2022\t\nanemia, a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the body\u2019s cells from getting enough oxygen\n\n\u2022\t\narthritis, a condition in which a person has pain and swelling in one or more joints\n\n\u2022\t\nhigh levels of amino acids, protein, uric acid, and carbohydrates in urine\n\n\u2022\t\nlow platelet or white blood cell count\n\n\u2022\t\nosteoporosis, a condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture<\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q498","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Wilson Disease National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse Logo of the U.S. Department...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID498"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_eCZAHAZL4G2MmLr","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID595","SecondaryAttribute":"Zorin OS is an alternative to Windows and macOS, designed to make your computer faster, more powe...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Zorin OS is an alternative to Windows and macOS, designed to make your computer faster, more powerful and secure as it's easy to use.
